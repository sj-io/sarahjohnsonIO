    "text": "Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nNational Housing Act of 1934\n“The broad objectives of the act were to:\n\nencourage lenders to invest in housing construction, and\nstimulate employment in the building industry.\n\n\n(P.L. 73-479, June 27, 1934)\n\nThe Act created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The FHA insured lenders against losses on home modernization and home improvement loans, created the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund to fund the operation of the newly created mortgage insurance programs, and established national mortgage associations to buy and sell mortgages.”\n“The FHA also institutionalized” the idea of 20-year mortgages. “If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured the lender for full repayment.”\n“In the early 1930s, a housing division was added to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration (WPA). The Housing Division acquired land across the country and built multifamily housing projects for lower-income families. However, the Housing Division’s activities proved controversial with local government officials who felt they were not consulted in the process.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nThis Act “created the Federal Housing Administration, established the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and authorized the chartering of national mortgage associations to provide a secondary mortgage market. This Act was to spawn three major governmental institutions that would play a significant part over the next three decades in encouraging the large-scale provision of single-family housing in this country.\nThe Federal Housing Administration, by demonstrating the feasibility of long-term mortgages and low down-payments, now an accepted practice in the mortgage field, would in later years be the means by which the great spurt in suburban development that took place after the Second World War would be made possible.\nThe vast system of federally insured savings and loan associations would be another important cog in the ever-increasing percentage of homeownership that was to be seen during this period.\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association, chartered pursuant to the provisions of the National Housing Act, would show the way to a true national market for federally insured or guaranteed housing mortgage paper.” (Coan 1969)\n\n\nNational Housing Act of 1937\nThis act “replaced the WPA’s Housing Division by establishing the U.S. Housing Agency (a precursor to today’s Dept. of Housing and Urban Development), and a new Low-Rent Public Housing program. States that wished to receive assistance in building low-rent public housing were required to establish quasi-governmental local public housing authorities (PHAs). These PHAs could then apply to the federal government for funding in the construction and maintenance” of developments.\n\n(P.L. 75-412, September 1, 1937)\n\n“The act declared that it was United States policy to\n\npromote the general welfare of the nation by employing its funds and credit, as provided in this Act, to assist the several states and their political subdivisions to alleviate present and recurring unemployment and to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income, in rural or urban communities, that are injurious to the health, safety, and morals of the citizens of the nation.\n\nHousing was later a major issue in the presidential and congressional races of 1948, with Harry S. Truman pledging to address the postwar housing shortage and urban slums.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nThis Act, “building upon experience developed under earlier legislation which authorized the Federal Government to build housing for those who could not afford it in the private market, initiated the low-rent public housing program, basically unchanged in concept [in 1969]. This Act, with its emphasis upon the clearance of an equivalent number of substandard or slum dwelling units for those built by a local housing authority with Federal assistance, also was a forerunner to later legislation that focused specifically on the elimination of slum properties.\nDuring the war years, the Federal Government’s involvement in housing was primarily directed toward providing shelter for military personnel and defense workers and their families. However, one of the major provisions enacted during this time was Title VI of the National Housing Act (P.L. 77-24), which would be later modified to encourage the insurance of mortgages financed under extremely liberal terms for the purpose of providing rental housing for veterans. This program would later come to be known as the ‘608’ program.” (Coan 1969)"

The 4%, 30-year Veterans Administration-insured mortgage not only allowed easy access to home mortgages, but by 1965 it had also contributed to the reduction of the annual cost of home ownership from 30% of median income to 21%.

Truman\n\nHousing Act of 1949\nThis Act “declared the goal of ‘a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.’ The act:\n\n(P.L. 81-171, July 15, 1949)\n\n\nestablished a federal urban redevelopment and slum clearance program, authorizing federal loans of $1 billion over a 5-year period to help local redevelopment agencies acquire slum properties and assemble sites for redevelopment;\nreactivated the public housing program for low-income families (which had been on hold during World War II), authorizing subsidies to local housing authorities sufficient to build 810,000 units over six years;\nexpanded the FHA’s mortgage insurance program to promote home building and homeownership;\ncreated within the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture a program of financial assistance and subsidies to improve housing conditions on farms and in rural areas; and\nauthorized federal grants for research, primarily to improve the productivity of the housing industry.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n“It was in this Act that a National Housing Policy was set forth by the Congress, including the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family. To help achieve this goal, a very substantial increase was made in the amount of low-rent public housing authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, and a comprehensive program of assistance for the provision of rural housing was authorized by the Dept. of Agriculture. However, this goal was not quantified until the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.\nAnother major feature of the 1949 Act was the institution of Federal assistance in the form of loans and grants to cities to carry out slum clearance and urban redevelopment activities. This program, now known as the urban renewal program, was a recognition that serious environmental problems existed in the older sections of our cities, that many of the problems could not be corrected without a complete clearance of the existing deteriorated and dilapidated structures and a complete rebuilding of these areas for both housing and non-housing uses, and that it was a Federal responsibility to help the cities cope with these problems. With the enactment of this program, the government was now committed to concerning itself with the urban environmental needs of the country as well as its housing needs.” (Coan 1969)\n“Democrats and Republicans joined to pass the landmark Housing Act of 1949, which committed the country to ‘the goal of a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family.’ The act also authorized the Urban Redevelopment Program, which provided federal funds for the demolition of slum housing in cities that established an urban renewal authority.\nAlthough the Housing Act of 1949 was relatively comprehensive in scope, political leaders remained reluctant to displace the private sector’s dominance in the housing industry. The U.S. Congress under President Harry Truman declined to include in the act a direct federal loan program for housing authorities and a housing program for low-income families ineligible for public housing. Even the Slum Clearance Program (later called “urban renewal”) financed urban demolition rather than development to provide an incentive for private builders to invest in urban areas instead of the more easily developed suburbs.\nThe private sector-public funding model of home ownership was not the only housing problem in postwar America. The New Deal had laid the groundwork for what became a “two-tract” housing system: government-supported home ownership for the middle class and limited “special” governmental programs for low-income renters. A Commission on Housing appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower examined the failures and inequalities of the two systems. The commission’s report led to the passage of the Housing Act of 1954.” (Soifer et al. 2014)"

    "text": "Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nHousing Act of 1954\nThis act “authorized a broadening of the slum clearance and urban redevelopment program to include assistance for not only clearance activities, but also efforts aimed at preserving existing structures in run-down areas, where rehabilitation and conservation activities could bring these structures and their surroundings up to a reasonable standard and achieve the re-establishment of a stable neighborhood.\n\n(P.L. 83-560, August 2, 1954)\n\nThe Act required (now known as the workable program for community improvement) that a community, in order to qualify for assistance under the urban renewal and low-rent public housing programs, as well as certain FHA programs enacted to complete the urban renewal program, must indicate a willingness on a planned basis to take such necessary steps on its own as were possible to prevent further deterioration and work toward the establishment and preservation of a desirable community.\nThe 1954 Act also rechartered the Federal National Mortgage Association with the explicit intention that it ultimately be converted to full private ownership, a goal to be realized in the 1968 Act, and authorized the initiation of the urban planning assistance program, commonly known as the ‘701’ program. This latter program, initially authorizing Federal grants to assist planning in communities under 25,000 population and for metropolitan areas, was the Federal Government’s first decisive legislative step in the broad area of urban development as opposed to the narrower concern of good housing and the removal of blight.” (Coan 1969)\n“First, the law acknowledged that private mortgage insurance mechanisms of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) would not work for the inner city, so it established special insurance for housing in urban renewal areas. Second, the law also allowed private financing under the restructured Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae).\nBy allowing private investors to meet the demand for home mortgage money, Fannie Mae placed no demands on the federal budget. However, investor demands to limit risk soon pushed Fannie Mae and the FHA away from acting in the older areas of cities, diluting the intended benefits of the legislation.\nThe 1954 Housing Act required urban renewal authorities to submit a workable program for redevelopment after slum clearance in an attempt to correct the unilateral destruction of inner-city neighborhoods. The controversy over community destruction and its racial implications fueled action by progressive planners, settlement house and community workers, and civil rights leaders. Their unified response to “federal bulldozers” and “Negro removal,” as they termed this community destruction, resulted in improved relocation benefits for renters and citizen participation in planning in the reauthorization of the Housing Act in 1961.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n\n\nHousing Act of 1959\nThis Act “was the first significant instance where government incentives were used to persuade private developers to build housing that would be affordable to low- and moderate-income households.” Section 202 was the Housing for the Elderly program, through which “the federal government extended low-interest loans to private nonprofit organizations for the developments of affordable housing for moderate-income residents age 62 and older. Low-interest rates were meant to ensure that units would be affordable, with nonprofit developers able to charge lower rents and still have adequate revenue to pay back the government loans…\n\n(P.L. 86-372, September 23, 1959)\n\nSection 202 is the only federal housing program that funds housing exclusively for elderly persons, although from approximately 1964 to 1990, non-elderly persons with disabilities were eligible for residency in Section 202 properties. Although the Section 202 program initially provided low-interest loans to nonprofit developers, since the early 1990s the program has provided nonprofit developers with capital grants, together with project rental assistance contracts (rental assistance that is similar to project-based Section 8). The current version of the Section 202 program serves very low-income elderly households (those with incomes at or below 50% of area median income).” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)"

    "text": "John F. Kennedy\n\nHousing Act of 1961\nThis Act “further expanded the role of the private sector in providing housing to low- and moderate-income households. The act created the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) housing program, which both insured mortgages to private developers of multifamily housing and provided loans to developers at low interest rates. The BMIR program expanded to pool of eligible borrowers to private for-profit developers and government entities, as well as nonprofit developers. Eligible developers included cooperatives, limited-dividend corporations, and state or local government agencies. Like the Section 202 program, the low interest rates in the BMIR program were meant to ensure that building owners could offer affordable rents to tenants.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 87-70, June 30, 1961)\n\nThis Act “created below-market interest rate subsidies known as the 221(d)(3) and 221(d)(4) programs and enabled the government to step in to purchase housing project mortgages. Public housing for the poorest families was expanded, and 100,000 units of low-rent public housing were added for the lowest income families. As a result, the below-market subsidy mechanisms established a second mode of ‘poor people’s housing’ that was separate from the conventional real estate industry and the income mix that had previously characterized minority neighborhoods.\nEven though President Kennedy allocated $2 billion for urban renewal, the increased federal spending under the Housing Act of 1961 emphasized physical development as the answer to housing problems in poor neighborhoods. Although the direct federal development support did help fill the vacuum left by the departure of the private sector from these neighborhoods, the public housing and government programs that replaced the private sector functions created an even larger divide between poor families and mainstream markets.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nThis Act “saw the first major effort by the Federal Government to attempt to provide housing for that large segment of the population whose incomes were too high to permit them to qualify for low-rent public housing, but too low to afford standard housing available in the private market. This was done through amendments to Section 221 of the National Housing Act, which had been enacted in 1954 for the purpose of providing favorable financing terms for housing for families displaced as a result of urban renewal or other governmental activities.\nThis took two forms: first, through the insurance of 3% down payment mortgages for terms up to 40 years on homes; and secondly, through the insurance of mortgages for apartment projects with interest rates set at the average cost to the Federal Government of borrowing money. This latter provision, commonly known as the 221(d)(3) below-market interest rate (BMIR) program, authorized 100% mortgages to public bodies, nonprofit organizations, and cooperatives, and 90% mortgages to corporations willing to limit their return to not in excess of 6% per year on their 10% equity investment. The funds for these below-market interest rate loans were to be made available by the Federal National Mortgage Association under its special assistance program, first authorized in 1954 to support mortgages for which there was not a ready market.\nThe 1961 Act also saw a major step forward in the Federal Government’s concern about the way the country’s urban areas were growing and the environment which was being created in these areas. It authorized grants to assist states and local communities to acquire land for the provision of permanent open space and the first direct assistance for the provision of mass transportation facilities in urban areas.” (Coan 1969)"

    "text": "Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nHousing Act of 1964\nThis Act, “among other things, endeavored to further encourage rehabilitation, instead of the clearance of run-down urban neighborhoods, by authorizing a direct 3% loan program to property owners to rehabilitate their properties located in urban renewal areas and the first Federal assistance for code enforcement efforts by a community.\n\n(P.L. 88-560, September 2, 1964)\n\nThe Act also took cognizance of the fact that the ever-increasing complexity of the problems confronting our urban areas and the number of programs to deal with them had caused a new problem– the lack of enough, adequately trained persons to deal with them. It authorized direct Federal assistance to States to establish programs to train professionals in community development and Federal fellowships for the graduate training of city planners and other urban oriented specialists.” (Coan 1969)\n\n\nHousing and Urban Development Act of 1965\nThis Act “added rental assistance to the list of incentives for private multifamily housing developers that participated in the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program. The Rent Supplement Program… capped the rents charged to participating tenants at 20% of their incomes and paid building owners the difference between 20% of a tenant’s income and fair market rent. P.L. 89-117 also created the Section 23 leased housing program, which was the first program to provide rent subsidies for use with existing private rental market units.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 89-117, August 10, 1965)\n\n“A major step to involve the private sector in the provision of housing for those who could not afford it was taken in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 with the enactment of the rent supplement program as a private counterpart to the low-rent public housing program. Under this program, a family with an income low enough to qualify for public housing could obtain a unit in a privately owned rental project with a market rate mortgage insured by FHA, paying 25% of its monthly income toward its rent, with the remainder being paid on its behalf to the project owners by the Federal Government. As the family’s income increased, the subsidy would decrease until ultimately the family would be able to pay the full cost of its rent. This Act fixed the maximum interest rate on the 221(d)(3) BMIR program at 3% instead of tying it to the going Federal rate, which was now threatening to reach 4%. It enacted a provision authorizing a local public housing authority to utilize the assistance received for the Federal Government to lease units in privately owned buildings for eligible low-income tenants, rather than constructing publicly owned projects.\nThe 1965 Act further expanded the Federal Government’s concern about the quality of our environment and the way in which our urban areas were growing. The open-space land program was substantially expanded; grants were authorized to help communities to provide water and sewer facilities and neighborhood centers and to acquire land needed for future development; and FHA mortgage insurance was authorized to cover the cost of acquiring and readying, through the installation of necessary site improvements, large tracts of land for the development of residential and related uses.\nAlso in 1965, the Congress recognized that the problems of the city had come of age and should be considered on a par with agriculture, parks and other major concerns of the Nation by establishing the Department of Housing and Urban Development.” (Coan 1969)\n\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1968\nThe Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act, “prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or financing of housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and handicap” (familial status and handicap were added as part of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, P.L. 100-430). “In addition to prohibiting discrimination, the Fair Housing Act also requires HUD and other federal agencies to administer their housing and urban development programs in ways that affirmatively further fair housing. In other words, as determined by courts, HUD is to prevent segregation and ensure that housing is open to everyone.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 90-284, April 11, 1968)\n\n\n\nHousing and Urban Development Act of 1968\nThis Act “created the Section 236 and Section 235 programs. In the Section 236 program, the government subsidized private developers’ mortgage interest payments so that they would not pay more than 1% toward interest. Some Section 236 units also received rent subsidies (referred to a Rental Assistance Payments [RAP]) to make them affordable to the lowest-income tenants. The Section 235 program instituted mortgage interest reduction payments similar to the Section 236 program, but for individual homeowners rather than multifamily housing developers. Through it, eligible borrowers could obtain FHA-insured mortgages with subsidized interest rates. As the program was originally enacted, HUD was to make subsidy payments to the lender in order to reduce the interest rate on the mortgage to as low as 1%…\n\n(P.L. 90-448, August 1, 1968)\n\nThe Section 236 program provided mortgage insurance to housing developers for the construction and rehabilitation of rental housing, and it continues to provide mortgage subsidies to building owners through a mechanism called Interest Reduction Payments (IRPs). IRPs are subsidies to owners that ensure they will only pay 1% interest on their mortgages. Given the reduced financing costs, owners can charge below-market rents for Section 236 units.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n“In [this] Act, the model cities program was authorized. Enactment of this program represented a recognition of the fact that it was often not sufficient to just renew the physical character of a neighborhood. It was also necessary to improve the social and economic conditions of the area: in effect, to give the people who lived in the large blighted areas of our cities not only the opportunity to have sound building and well paved streets, but also the opportunity to realize such basic goals as adequate employment, good education and proper medial care. It represents a recognition that these improvements must be achieved on a coordinated basis by a concentration of Federal, state, local, and private efforts and that the people whose lives are to be affected by these activities should have an opportunity to participate in the decisions affecting them.” (Coan 1969)\n“The United States was still reeling from urban riots in the late 1960s… The mainstream political establishment, in an attempt to pacify, rectify, or maybe even buy off the public (depending on one’s political views), responded immediately. The goal became to increase black home ownership as quickly as possible, and the Section 235 and 236 Programs, which addressed minority home ownership and indigenous nonprofit ownership of rental property respectively, were established in the Housing Act of 1968…\nAbuse and failure were the consequences of such a grand gesture. Money in the Section 235 Program flowed through whatever mechanisms generated the highest volume and numbers. Whatever positive effects the program had on building the assets of African Americans (Johnson & Sherraden, 1992) has to be balanced with the unintended side effect of destroying neighborhoods. Realtors used scare tactics and other block-busting methods to increase the volume of property available to first-time black homebuyers. They infiltrated predominantly which and integrated neighborhoods on the edges of ghettos and incited white flight. Adequate screening and support of homebuyers were sacrificed for volume (Pietilla, 2010). Virtually the whole west side of Chicago, the east and inner west side of Detroit, as well as other similar urban neighborhoods, experienced a cataclysmic change. The process was so corrupt that many realtors, mortgage bankers, and FHA officials went to jail for exploiting and abusing the program…\nThe Section 236 Program, which provided for nonprofit ownership of rental property, also fell victim to the “increase numbers at any cost” directive. This program was seen as an untapped vehicle to increase property ownership in the black community, so the federal government aggressively pursued black nonprofit institutions (e.g. fraternal organizations, churches) as sponsors for large-scale subsidized apartment properties. To compensate for the organizations’ inexperience in property management, HUD included the services of a consultant in each property deal. The consultant’s job was to assist the sponsor with planning the project as well as aiding in the application, negotiation, and acquisition phases of securing the property. For this service, the consultant received a 1% commission, payable at the time of the property’s closing.\nThe consultants were motivated to close deals and were effective at getting projects through the commitment pipeline to construction. However, as soon as the deal was done, the consultant moved on to the next project and the next commission, leaving an inexperienced nonprofit organization to manage the property. The result was chaos, and many projects failed. The federal government shouldered the negative financial impact of a high rate of foreclosures as well as a growing hostility toward nonprofit housing corporations among the public and federal agency staff…\nThe political pressures on the Model Cities program to produce large-scale results quickly also condemned the program to failure. For example, it called on community institutions to increase the volume of housing production by 400 to 1000% in just a year or two. The complications of achieving volume overwhelmed the program’s capacity and spirit. The government could not, or did not, continue to provide the massive, long-term resources that were needed in order to continue. Johnson’s attention subsequently shifted from the domestic housing agenda to the Vietnam War. Without adequate resources and federal support, the Model Cities program was ultimately canceled in 1974.” (Soifer et al. 2014)"

Over time, as operating costs rose, there was a concern that the below-market rents being charged were too high to be affordable to the poorest families. The Brooke Amendment, which was included as part of [this Act], limited tenant contributions toward rent in all rent assisted units (including public housing and all project-based rental assistance units) to an amount equal to 25% of tenant income (this was later raised to 30%).

    "text": "Richard Nixon\n\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974\n“By the early 1970s, concern was growing about the cost, efficacy, and equity of the construction-based housing subsidy programs, such as the Section 236 and public housing programs… President Nixon declared a moratorium on all new activity under the major housing subsidy programs– except for the Section 23 leased-housing program… Assisted housing activity slowly restarted in response to lawsuits and new legislation.\n\n(P.L. 93-383, August 22, 1974)\n\nThe [1974 Act] was the first omnibus housing legislation since 1968… The act created a new low-income rental assistance program, referred to as Section 8. Although the 1960s had seen rental assistance programs like Rent Supplement and Section 23, the scale of the Section 8 program made it the first comprehensive rental assistance program. The Section 8 program combined features of the Section 236 program, which was popular with advocates of construction-based subsidies, and the Section 23 leased-housing program, which used the existing stock and was popular with the Nixon Administration. Through Section 8, the federal government provided private property owners monthly assistance payments for new or substantially rehabilitated rental units. In exchange for monthly rental payments, property owners agreed to rent to eligible low-income families (defined as families with incomes at or below 80% of local area median income), who would pay an income-based rent. It also provided PHAs with the authority to enter into rental assistance contracts for existing, private market units that met certain quality standards.\n…The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program… is administered by HUD. ..Its purpose is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities primarily for low- and moderate-income persons. The CDBG program distributes 70% of total funds through formula grants to entitlement communities– central cities of metropolitan areas, cities with population of 50,000 or more, and urban counties– and the remaining 30% goes to states for use in small, non-entitlement communities.\nRecipient communities may use CDBG funds for a variety of activities, although at least 70% of funds much be used to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Eligible activities include the acquisition and rehabilitation of property for purposes such as public works, urban beautification, and historic preservation; the demolition of blighted properties; services such as crime prevention, child care, drug abuse counseling, education, or recreation; neighborhood economic development projects; the rehabilitation or development of housing; and housing counseling services.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n“President Richard Nixon came to office determined to cut federal domestic spending on antipoverty, urban renewal, housing, employment and training, education, and welfare programs. He offered local politicians a compromise: In exchange for fewer federal funds and smaller budgets, he would give them more control over how they spend the federal funds they received… [through] a ‘block grant.’\n… [T]he Nixon administration… locked horns with Congress and was unable to make the changes it desired to existing federal housing and development programs quickly. Therefore, Nixon issued an executive order that placed a moratorium on housing expenditures, freezing even projects that had already received federal commitment for redevelopment. The impasse between Nixon and Congress was not resolved until the Housing Act of 1974, which merged existing urban renewal programs into the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and consolidated a variety of housing programs into the Section 8 rent subsidies program.” (Soifer et al. 2014)"

The CRA affirms that federally insured depository institutions have an obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered and accept deposits, consistent with financial safety and soundness considerations, and requires federal banking regulators to assess the extent to which banks are meeting those needs. The enactment of the CRA grew out of concern that banking deposits were funding lending activities across the country at the expense of providing credit in certain areas where deposits were collected, thereby contributing to neighborhood disinvestment.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 95-128, October 12, 1977)\n\n“While courting private lenders to make mortgage and business loans in viable but economically threatened neighborhoods, organizers accidentally discovered the practice of redlining… In response, Congress enacted the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which required financial institutions to report the geographic origins of their deposits and the destination of the investments.

The [1983 Act] repealed HUD’s authority to enter into new Section 8 contracts tied to new construction and substantial rehabilitation, but retained HUD’s authority to issue new contracts for existing properties. The act also created a new demonstration program to test a modified use of Section 9, referred to as vouchers. Vouchers were similar to the use of Section 8 rent subsidies in existing housing, but they provided more flexibility to PHAs, particularly by permitting families to pay more than 30% of their incomes in rent. The demonstration was made permanent in 1985.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 98-181, November 30, 1983)\n\nRelated Acts:\n(P.L. 98-45, July 12, 1983) Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1984\n(P.L. 98-479, October 17, 1984) Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984\n\n\nTax Reform Act of 1986\n“[T]he Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was created as part of the [1986 Tax Act]. The LIHTC was not initially part of the bill that became the Tax Reform Act (H.R. 3838). However, because portions of H.R. 3838 eliminated the favorable treatment of real estate investment income, Members added the LIHTC program to the bill to ensure that developers would have an incentive to continue to construct low- and moderate-income housing. The LIHTC, intentially or not, was one of the first major programs to give a good deal of control over federal funding for housing to states. Tax credits are allocated to states based on population, and states have discretion in setting priorities as to how the credits will be used. While states much prioritize projects that serve the lowest-income tenants for the longest period of time, they may choose to allocate credits based on criteria such as the tenant populations served (e.g., those with special needs, families with children, or those on public housing waiting lists)…\n\n(P.L. 99-514, October 22, 1986)\n\nThe LIHTC… provides incentives for the development of affordable rental housing through federal tax credits administered through the Internal Revenue Service… The tax credits are disbursed to state housing finance agencies (HFAs) based on population. HFAs, in turn, award the credits to housing developers that agree to build or rehabilitate housing in which a certain percentage of units will be affordable to low-income households. Housing developers then sell the credits to investors and use the proceeds to help finance the housing developments. The benefit of the tax credits to the purchasing investors is that they reduce the investor’s federal income tax liability annually over a 10-year period.\nBecause tax credits reduce the amount of private financing required to build or rehabilitate housing, the owners of developments financed through tax credits are able to charge lower rents. To qualify for the tax credits, one of three criteria must be met:\n\nat least 20% of units in a development must be occupied by households with incomes at or below 50% of area median income;\nat least 40% of units must be occupied by households with incomes at or below 60% of area median income;\nor, more recently, properties have been allowed to adopt an ‘income-averaging’ approach that enables them to serve a mix of higher-income families if they also serve lower-income families, as long as it results in an average of 40% of units being occupied by households with incomes that average 60% or below of area median income (the income-averaging approach was authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 [P.L. 115-141]).\n\nRent charged for the rent-restricted units in a development may not exceed 30% of an imputed income limitation– calculated based on area median incomes. Units financed with tax credits must remain affordable for at least 15 years, although states may choose to adopt longer use restrictions. As of 2018, more than 2.3 million units had been placed in service using LIHTCs.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n\nStewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987\nCongress passed this Act which “included funding for several grants that states and localities could use to assist people experiencing homelessness. Grants were available for permanent and transitional housing, as well as supportive services, with the idea that localities are in a better position to know how to serve the people living in their communities.\n\n(P.L. 100-77, July 22, 1987)\n\n…The grants have gone through several permutations since their enactment, with the most recent change taking place when they were reauthorized in the 111th Congress…” (see below, P.L. 111-22) (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)"

Bush\n\nNational Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA)\nThis Act authorized the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, “a housing block grant program administered by HUD and designed to expand the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing… HOME funding is allocated via formula: 60% of funds are awarded to”participating jurisdictions” (localities that have populations above a certain threshold and qualify for a certain amount of funding under the formula), and 40% are awarded to states. HOME grantees must match 25% of their HOME grants (with some exceptions) and submit a plan to HUD detailing their community housing needs and priorities.\n\n(P.L. 101-625, November 28, 1990)\n\nHOME funds can be used for four main purposes: rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing, homebuyer assistance, rental housing construction and rehabilitation, and the provision of tenant-based rental assistance. All HOME funds must be used to benefit low-income families (those with incomes at or below 80% of area median income), and at least 90% of funds used for rental housing activities or tenant-based rental assistance must be used to benefit families with incomes at or below 60% of area median income.\n…The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program was created in 1990 as part of [this Act]… Until the enactment of Section 811, the Section 202 program provided housing for persons with disabilities.\nThrough Section 811, HUD provides capital grants to nonprofit organizations to create rental housing that is affordable to very low-income households (income at or below 50% of AMI) with an adult who has a disability. The program also funds project rental assistance contract to subsidize the rent paid by tenants. Housing built with capital grants may include group homes, independent living facilities, multifamily rental units, condominium units, and cooperative housing. Section 811 developers must provide supportive services to those residing in the units.\nIn addition, through FY2010 the Section 811 program created tenant-based rental assistance, sometimes called ‘mainstream vouchers,’ that tenants could use to find housing in the private market, much like Section 8 vouchers. However, since FY2011 (based on a law enacted in 2010 [P.L. 111-374]), Section 811 tenant-based assistance has been funded via the Section 8 account. Also as part of P.L. 111-374, Section 811 rental assistance funds were made available to be used in conjunction with capital funding from other sources (such as LIHTC and HOME funds).\n…The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program is the only federal program that provides funding specifically for housing for persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related illnesses. ..HOPWA program funding is distributed both by formula allocation and competitive grants. HUD awards 90% of appropriated funds by formula to states and eligible metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that meet thresholds regarding population, AIDS cases, and AIDS incidence. Recipient states and MSAs may allocate grants to nonprofit organizations or administer the funds through government agencies. HOPWA grantees may use funds for a wide range of housing, social services, program planning, and development costs.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nJack Kemp, HUD secretary under George H. W. Bush, “expanded HUD’s economic development role, created new programs to encourage tenant management and tenant ownership of public housing, and promoted an enterprise zone approach to city and economic development. Kemp divested the secretary position of practically all discretionary authority, leaving only formula block grants and competitive bidding as means of awarding HUD funds. He also initiated a number of programs called HOPE I, II, and III to convert rental and foreclosed housing to homes available for ownership.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nHOPE stands for Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everwhere. “HOPE I helps low-income people buy public housing units by providing funds that nonprofit organizations, resident groups, and other eligible grantees can use to develop and implement homeownership programs. HOPE I is authorized by the National Affordable Housing Act (P.L. 101-625), which added a new Title III to the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.” (HUD, n.d.)"

The purpose of HOPE VI was to fund public housing authorities’ demolition of high-rise public housing and to replace it with lower-density, mixed-income, mixed-use projects that were developed by the private sector and large nonprofits. Despite some liberal opposition favoring one-to-one replacement of units as they were demolished, HOPE VI moved forward to eliminate virtually every dense high-rise project in the country. Tenants who were displaced and chose not to come back were given Section 8 vouchers.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n\n(P.L. 102-389, October 6, 1992)\n\nNote: For additional reading, on HOPE VI, see HUD’s overview and a 2004 report from the Urban Institute “A Decade of HOPE VI: Research Findings and Policy Challenges”.\n\n\nNative American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)\nThis Act “reorganized the system of federal housing assistance to Native Americans by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with a single block grant program. In addition to simplifying the process of providing housing assistance, a purpose of NAHASDA was to provide federal assistance for [Native American] tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of [Native American] self-determination and tribal self-governance.\n\n(P.L. 104-330, October 3, 1996)\n\n…The act provides block grants to Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) to use for a wide range of affordable housing activities through the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) program. The tribe must submit an Indian housing plan (IHP), which is reviewed by HUD for compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. Funding is provided under a need-based formula, which was developed pursuant to negotiated rulemaking between tribal representatives and HUD. Tribes and TCHEs can leverage funds, within certain limits, by using future grants as collateral to obtain private loans for affordable housing activities under the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n\nMultifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (MAHRA)\nThis Act was created “to preserve affordable housing. ..Through this effort, HUD restructures the debt of building owners while at the same time renegotiating their rental assistance contracts.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 105-65, October 9, 1997) Title V\n\n\n\nQuality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA)\n“Throughout the 1990s, concern about the state of public housing grew. The public perceived public housing to be mismanaged, of poor quality, and dangerous. At the same time, interest was growing in reforming social programs by devolving control to the states and increasing the programs’ focus on promoting work and self-sufficiency. Concern over the condition of public housing– and the influence of the 1996 welfare reform debate and legislation– led to proposals for major public and assisted housing reforms. Several years of debate in Congress culminated with the enactment of [QHWRA].\n\n(P.L. 105-276, October 8, 1998)\n\nThe purposes of QHWRA, as defined in the act, were to deregulate PHAs, provide PHAs with more flexibility in their use of federal assistance, facilitate mixed income communities, decrease concentrations of poverty in public housing, increase accountability and reward effective management of PHAs, create incentives and economic opportunities for residents assisted by PHAs to work and become self-sufficient, consolidate the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single market-driven program, remedy the problems of troubled PHAs, and replace or revitalize severely distressed public housing projects.\nSpecific reforms in QHWRA included increased income targeting in the voucher program, removal of federal preference categories for housing assistance, enactment of a limited community service requirement in public housing, creation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (a hybrid of the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs), authorization of the HOPE VI program, consolidation and reform of funding for public housing, and modifications to the assessment systems of PHAs. QHWRA also featured the so-called “Faircloth Amendment,” which prohibited the use of public housing funding for the development of any net new units of public housing.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nAs part of QHWRA, “Congress passed a HUD request… for major reconstruction of public housing, allowing all local public housing authorities the freedom to develop HOPE VI-type mixed-income, mixed-use projects under its general authority and funding.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n“Section 9(g)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (”Faircloth Amendment”) limits the construction of new public housing units. The Faircloth Amendment states that the Department cannot fund the construction or operation of new public housing units with Capital or Operating Funds if the construction of those units would result in a net increase in the number of units the PHA owned, assisted or operated as of October 1, 1999.” (HUD 2020)"

Limitation of landlord’s liability.\nUnless otherwise agreed, a landlord who conveys premises that include a dwelling unit subject to a rental agreement in a good faith sale to a bona fide purchaser, landlord or agent, or both, is relieved of liability under the rental agreement and this chapter as to events occurring subsequent to written notice to the tenant of the conveyance and transfer of the security deposit to the bona fide purchaser."

If the tenant vacates pursuant to this section, accounting for rent is to occur as of the date the tenant returns the keys to the landlord or has, in fact, vacated the dwelling unit or premises whichever date is earlier.\n\n\n66-28-504. Unlawful ouster, exclusion, or diminution of service.\nIf the landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or willfully diminishes services to the tenant by interrupting essential services as provided in the rental agreement to the tenant, the tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either case, recover actual damages sustained by the tenant, and punitive damages when appropriate, plus a reasonable attorney’s fee. If the rental agreement is terminated under this section, the landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security deposits.\n\n\n66-28-505. Noncompliance by tenant — Failure to pay rent.\n(a)\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a noncompliance with §66-28-401 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in subdivisions (a)(2) or (a)(3).\n(2) If the breach for which notice was given in subdivision (a)(1) is remediable by the payment of rent, the cost of repairs, damages, or any other amount due to the landlord pursuant to the rental agreement, the landlord may inform the tenant that if the breach is not remedied within fourteen (14) days after receipt of such notice, the rental agreement shall terminate, subject to the following:\n\n(A) All repairs to be made by the tenant to remedy the tenant’s breach must be requested in writing by the tenant and authorized in writing by the landlord prior to such repairs being made; provided, however, that the notice sent pursuant to this subdivision (a)(2) shall inform the tenant that prior written authorization must be given by the landlord to the tenant pursuant to this subdivision (a)(2)(A); and\n(B) If substantially the same act or omission which constituted a prior noncompliance of which notice was given recurs within six (6) months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least seven (7) days’ written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement.\n\n(3) If the breach for which notice was given in subdivision (a)(1) is not remediable by the payment of rent, the cost of repairs, damages, or any other amount due to the landlord pursuant to the rental agreement, the landlord may inform the tenant that the rental agreement shall terminate upon a date not less than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice.\n(4) Nothing in subdivision (a)(2) or (a)(3) shall be construed as requiring a landlord to provide additional notice to the tenant other than the notice required by this section.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if the tenant waives any notice required by this section, the landlord may proceed to file a detainer warrant immediately upon breach of the agreement for failure to pay rent without the landlord providing notice of such breach to the tenant; provided, however, that this subsection (b) shall not reduce the tenant’s grace period as provided in §66-28-201.

Failure of tenant to maintain dwelling.\nIf there is noncompliance by the tenant with §66-28-401 materially affecting health and safety that can be remedied by repair, replacement of a damaged item or cleaning, and the tenant fails to comply as promptly as conditions require in case of emergency or within fourteen (14) days after written notice by the landlord specifying the breach and requesting that the tenant remedy it within that period of time, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit and cause the work to be done in a workmanlike manner and submit an itemized bill for the actual and reasonable cost or the fair and reasonable value thereof as rent on the next date when periodic rent is due, or if the rental agreement has terminated, for immediate payment.\n\n\n66-28-507. Absence, nonuse or abandonment by tenant.\n(a) If the rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of seven (7) days as required in §66-28-404 and the tenant willfully fails to do so, the landlord may recover actual damages from the tenant.\n(b) During any absence of the tenant in excess of seven (7) days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary.\n(c) If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall use reasonable efforts to rerent the dwelling unit at a fair rental. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning prior to the expiration of the rental agreement, the rental agreement is terminated as of the date of the new tenancy. If the tenancy is from month-to-month, or week-to-week, the term of the rental agreement for this purpose shall be deemed to be a month or a week, as the case may be.\n\n\n66-28-508. Waiver of landlord’s right to terminate.\nIf the landlord accepts rent without reservation and with knowledge of a tenant default, the landlord by such acceptance condones the default and thereby waives such landlord’s right and is estopped from terminating the rental agreement as to that breach.\n\n\n66-28-509. Landlord liens.\nA contracted lien or security interest on behalf of the landlord in the tenant’s household goods shall not be enforceable unless perfected by a Uniform Commercial Code filing with the secretary of state.

If the tenant’s holdover is willful and not in good faith, the landlord, in addition, may also recover actual damages sustained by the landlord, plus reasonable attorney’s fees. If the landlord consents to the tenant’s continued occupancy, §66-28-201(c) shall apply.\n\n\n66-28-513. Remedies for abuse of access.\n(a) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access, or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the landlord may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n(b) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but which have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct, or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the tenant may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n\n66-28-514. Retaliatory conduct prohibited.\n(a) Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession because the tenant:\n\n(1) Has complained to the landlord of a violation under §66-28-301; or\n(2) Has made use of remedies provided under this chapter.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a landlord may bring an action for possession if:\n\n(A) The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in the tenant’s household or upon the premises with the tenant’s consent;\n(B) The tenant is in default in rent; or\n(C) Compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit.\n\n(2) The maintenance of the action does not release the landlord from liability under §66-28-501(b).\n\n\n\n66-28-515. Administration of remedies — Enforcement.\n(a) The remedies provided by this chapter shall be so administered that the aggrieved party may recover lawful damages. The aggrieved party has an obligation and duty to mitigate damages.\n(b) Any right or obligation declared by this chapter is enforceable by legal action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.\n\n\n66-28-516. Obligation of good faith.\nEvery duty under this chapter and every act which must be performed as a condition precedent to the exercise of a right or remedy under this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.\n\n\n66-28-517. Termination by landlord for violence or threats to health, safety, or welfare of persons or property.\n(a) A landlord may terminate a rental agreement within three (3) days from the date written notice is received by the tenant if the tenant or any other person on the premises with the tenant’s consent:\n\n(1) Willfully or intentionally commits a violent act;\n(2) Behaves in a manner which constitutes or threatens to be a real and present danger to the health, safety or welfare of the life or property of other tenants or persons on the premises;\n(3) Creates a hazardous or unsanitary condition on the property that affects the health, safety or welfare or the life or property of other tenants or persons on the premises; or\n(4) Refuses to vacate the premises after entering the premises as an unauthorized subtenant or other unauthorized occupant.\n\n(b) The notice required by this section shall specifically detail the violation which has been committed and shall be effective only from the date of receipt of the notice by the tenant.\n(c) Upon receipt of such written notice, the tenant shall be entitled to immediate access to any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining a temporary or permanent injunction against such termination by the landlord.\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a landlord to recover or take possession of the dwelling unit by action or otherwise including willful diminution of services to the tenant by interrupting or causing interruption of electric, gas or other essential service to the tenant except in the case of abandonment or surrender.\n(e) If the landlord’s action in terminating the lease under this provision is willful and not in good faith, the tenant may in addition recover actual damages sustained by the tenant plus reasonable attorney’s fees.\n(f) The failure to bring an action for or to obtain an injunction may not be used as evidence in any action to recover possession of the dwelling unit.\n(g)\n\n(1) If domestic abuse, as defined in §36-3-601, is the underlying offense for which a tenancy is terminated, only the perpetrator may be evicted. The landlord shall not evict the victims, minor children under eighteen (18) years of age, or innocent occupants, any of whom occupy the subject premises under a lease agreement, based solely on the domestic abuse. Even if evicted or removed from the lease, the perpetrator shall remain financially liable for all amounts due under all terms and conditions of the present lease agreement.\n(2) If a lease agreement is in effect at the time that the domestic abuse is committed, the landlord may remove the perpetrator from the lease agreement and require the remaining adult tenants to qualify for and enter into a new agreement for the remainder of the present lease term. The landlord shall not be responsible for any and all damages suffered by the perpetrator due to the bifurcation and termination of the lease agreement in accordance with this section.\n(3) If domestic abuse, as defined in §36-3-601, is the underlying offense for which tenancy could be terminated, the victim and all adult tenants shall agree, in writing, not to allow the perpetrator to return to the subject premises or any part of the community property, and to immediately report the perpetrator’s return to the proper authority, for the remainder of the tenancy. A violation of such agreement shall be cause to terminate tenancy as to any victim and all other tenants.\n(4) The rights under this section shall not apply until the victim has been judicially granted an order of protection against the perpetrator for the specific incident for which tenancy is being terminated, a copy of such order has been provided to the landlord, and the order:\n\n(A) Provides for the perpetrator to move out or vacate immediately;\n(B) Prohibits the perpetrator from coming by or to a shared residence;\n(C) Requires that the perpetrator stay away from the victim’s residence; or\n(D) Finds that the perpetrator’s continuing to reside in the rented or leased premises may jeopardize the life, health, and safety of the victim or the victim’s minor children.\n\n(5) Failure to comply with this section, or dismissal of an order of protection that allows application of this section, abrogates the rights provided to the victim, minor children, and innocent occupants under this section.\n(6) The rights granted in this section shall not apply in any situation where the perpetrator is a child or dependent of any tenant.\n(7) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the eviction of a victim of domestic abuse for non-payment of rent, a lease violation, or any violation of this chapter.\n\n\n\n66-28-518.

Termination of utility services.\nIf a written rental agreement requires the tenant to have utility services placed in the tenant’s name and the tenant fails to do so within three (3) days of occupancy of the rented premises, the landlord may have such utility services terminated if the existing utility service is in the name of the landlord.\n\n\n66-28-522.

The outstanding principal amount of the receiver’s lien carries interest at a standard statutory rate applicable to judgment liens as provided in § 67-5-2010;\nAct as a bar of any transfer of title of the subject parcel or of any interests pertaining to such subject parcel, including, but not limited to, transfers by tax sale or other foreclosure, transfers or creation of lien interests in the subject parcel, or otherwise, from the date of the filing until the petition is dismissed or until specific orders of the court authorizing a transfer of title, if the petition has attached a certificate of public nuisance issued pursuant to subsection (a); and\nAuthorize the municipal corporation, in its discretion, to access the subject parcel for boarding, securing, and maintaining the subject parcel at any time if it has been determined by the court that the owner has failed to do so. Any costs incurred by the municipal corporation shall be charged to the owner.\n\nNotice of a petition for a judgment in rem filed pursuant to subsection (a) shall, at a minimum, be provided to each owner and interested person identified by a thorough title search and examination of the subject parcel, including a search of court records of the county where the subject parcel is located. The petitioner shall file with the court a certification that notice has been provided pursuant to this subsection (d). Notice shall be provided by:\n\nSending a copy of the petition by first-class mail to the last known address of record;\nPosting a copy of the petition in a conspicuous place on the building;\nPublication of the petition in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the subject parcel is located; and\nSending a copy of the petition by first-class mail addressed to “occupant” at the subject parcel.\n\nIf the subject parcel is found to be a public nuisance, the court shall issue an order of compliance requiring the owner of the subject parcel to produce a plan for the abatement of the public nuisance. The acceptable petitioner shall file such order in the register’s office of the county where the subject parcel is located. The plan must comply with subsection (h) and must be approved by the court. If the owner has commenced work on the subject parcel prior to, or during the pendency of the action, the owner is required to provide a report of the work that has been completed to date, as well as a plan for the abatement of the public nuisance. Once a plan is approved by the court, the municipal corporation shall provide periodic updates to the court on the owner’s progress towards completion of the plan and other relevant information about the subject parcel and surrounding area. Upon a finding by the court that the subject parcel is a public nuisance, the court may award all reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the person filing the petition for a judgment in rem.\nIf the owner fails to comply with the court’s order of compliance pursuant to subsection (e), the court may allow an interested person the opportunity to undertake the work to abate the public nuisance pursuant to a plan that complies with subsection (h) submitted by such interested person.\nIf the actions pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) fail to abate the public nuisance, the court may authorize a receiver to take possession and control of the subject parcel to abate the public nuisance pursuant to a plan submitted by such receiver that complies with subsection (h). A receiver appointed pursuant to this chapter is not personally liable for actions taken pursuant to the receivership except for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in the performance of the functions of the office.\n\nPrior to ordering any action be taken to abate the public nuisance, the court shall cause a detailed development plan to be submitted for review, which must include, but is not limited to:\nA. A detailed budget for abating the public nuisance; B. A projected timeline for abating the public nuisance; C. If repair and rehabilitation of the subject parcel are found not to be feasible, the cost of demolition of the subject parcel or of the portions of the subject parcel that constitute the public nuisance; and D. The terms, conditions, and availability of any financing that is necessary to abate the public nuisance or a show of sufficient assets.\nIf the receiver is submitting the plan, the receiver may petition the court for authority to conduct an auction and sale to a qualified buyer, in accordance with subsection (j), without abatement of the public nuisance upon showing that the terms of the auction minimum bid will include a bond or other security, in an amount fixed by the court, ensuring performance of the remediation within nine (9) months of the date of the auction sale, executed by the qualified buyer in favor of the receiver.\n\n\nIf the court deems a plan submitted by a receiver to be sufficient and appropriate, the court may empower the receiver to:\nA. Take possession and control of the subject parcel; B. Pay all expenses of operating and conserving the subject parcel, including obtaining property insurance; C. Pay prereceivership mortgages or installments of such mortgages and other liens; and D. Implement the plan; provided, that, if the plan requires demolition, the court shall order that the demolition be done properly and in compliance with applicable laws.\nThe receiver shall file a report with the court every sixty (60) calendar days and, upon completion of the detailed development plan, shall file a final report with the court indicating that the public nuisance has been abated and moving for the establishment of the full amount of the receiver’s lien. Upon a finding by the court that the public nuisance has been abated and establishing the amount of the receiver’s lien, the owner shall be put on notice that the owner has thirty (30) days from such finding to satisfy the receiver’s lien in full. If the owner satisfies the receiver’s lien in full during such time, the receivership shall be terminated by order of the court.\n\nIf the receiver’s lien is not satisfied by the owner pursuant to subdivision (i)(2), the court shall direct the receiver to offer the subject parcel for sale in accordance with the following:\n\nThe sales procedure shall follow the procedures provided in §§ 35-5-101 — 35-5-109;\nThe minimum bid at a receiver’s lien sale shall be the full amount of the receiver’s lien;\nIf any local land bank formed pursuant to § 13-30-104 notifies the receiver in writing in advance of the receiver’s lien sale that it wishes to enter the minimum bid for cash for the subject parcel, then such minimum bid shall preempt all other bids, and the local land bank shall be the prevailing bidder;\nIf there is no bidder at the receiver’s lien auction for greater than the minimum bid, the subject parcel shall be transferred by receiver’s deed to the receiver, and there shall be no requirement of cash payment of the minimum bid by the receiver;\nWhen the successful bid is paid in cash, the amount of the minimum bid is paid to satisfy the receiver’s lien, including payment to the appropriate property tax officials, of that portion of the receiver’s lien that constituted delinquent property taxes. Any surplus shall be distributed, as approved by the court, to the owner and interested persons in the priority in which their interests encumbered the subject parcel prior to the auction; and\nThe receiver shall report the prevailing bid at the sale to the court, and upon approval by the court, a receiver’s deed shall be issued to the successful bidder and promptly recorded in the office of the register of deeds. The county trustee shall be allowed a credit pursuant to § 67-5-1903(b)(1) for any local taxes and assessments that are not collected as a result of the failure of the receiver’s lien sale to receive a cash payment for the minimum bid pursuant to subdivision (j)(2). Title shall be absolute in the purchaser, and the interests of any interested persons prior to the auction shall be terminated as of the date of the sale. The receivership shall be terminated after the sale by order of the court after a hearing on receiver’s motion for termination of the receivership.\n\n\nNothing in this chapter limits the powers granted to a court having jurisdiction pursuant to § 13-6-107.\nThe monetary and other limitations specified in § 16-15-501(d)(1) upon any court with jurisdiction over an action described in subsection (a) do not operate as limitations upon any of the following:\nA. Expenditures of a mortgagee, lienholder, other interested person, or receiver that has been selected pursuant to subsection (f) or (g) to undertake the work and to furnish the materials necessary to abate a public nuisance; B. Any notes issued by a receiver; C. Any mortgage granted by a receiver; D. Expenditures in connection with the foreclosure of a mortgage granted by a receiver in accordance with subsection (i); E. The enforcement of an order of a judge entered pursuant to this chapter; or F. The actions that may be taken pursuant to this chapter by a receiver or a mortgagee, lienholder, or other interested person that has been selected pursuant to subsection (f) or (g) to undertake the work and to furnish the materials necessary to abate a public nuisance.\nA judge in a civil action described in subsection (a), or the judge’s successor in office, has continuing jurisdiction to review and order correction of the condition of any subject parcel that was determined to be a public nuisance pursuant to this chapter."

I used purrr’s map_dfr() to do this automatically. Boundaries were then filtered in one of two ways, either using dplyr’s filter() function for table data or sf’s st_filter() to filter one geometry by another.\nIn summary, these are the packages I used to get started (I also recommend caching your datasets, but it’s optional).\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tigris)\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\noptions(tigris_year = 2021) # currently defaults to 2020\n\nBelow is a full list of how I gathered boundaries related to Memphis, grouped by how they’re filtered.\n\n#' Broad regions, filtered by known NAME/DIVISIONs relevant to Memphis Area\nnation <- nation()\nregions <- regions() %>% filter(NAME == \"South\")\ndivisions <- divisions() %>% filter(str_detect(NAME, \"South Central\"))\nstates <- states() %>% filter(DIVISION %in% c(6, 7))\n\n# The Memphis MSA include Tennessee, Mississippi, & Arkansas\nmemST <- list(\"TN\", \"MS\", \"AR\")\n\n#' Metro and Urban areas, filtered by \"Memphis\"\ncsa <- combined_statistical_areas() %>% filter(str_detect(NAME, \"Memphis\")) \ncbsa <- core_based_statistical_areas() %>% \n  filter(str_detect(NAME, \"Memphis\")) \nurb <- urban_areas() %>% filter(str_detect(NAME10, \"Memphis\"))\n\n#' Areas in Metro or Urban area\ncsaCounties <- map_dfr((memST), ~{counties(.x)}) %>% \n  st_filter(csa, .predicate = st_within)\n\ncounties <- csaCounties[cbsa, op = st_within]\n\nplaces <- map_dfr((memST), ~{places(.x)}) %>% \n  st_filter(cbsa, .predicate = st_within)\n\nsld <- state_legislative_districts(\"TN\") %>% \n  st_filter(cbsa, .predicate = st_within)\n\nzcta <- zctas(cb = TRUE, starts_with = c(\"38\", \"72\")) %>% st_filter(urb)\npuma <- map_dfr((memST), ~{pumas(.x)}) %>% st_filter(urb)\n\n\n#' Shelby County and Memphis\nshelby <- counties %>% filter(NAME == \"Shelby\")\nmemphis <- places %>% filter(NAME == \"Memphis\")\n\n#' Areas within Shelby County\nschool <- school_districts(\"TN\") %>% \n  st_filter(shelby, .predicate = st_within)\n\ncong <- congressional_districts(\"TN\") %>% \n  st_filter(shelby, .predicate = st_within)\n# cong2 <- congressional_districts(\"TN\") %>% \n#   st_filter(shelby)\n# includes the very large district 8\n\nvote <- voting_districts(\"TN\", \"Shelby\")\ncsd <- county_subdivisions(\"TN\", \"Shelby\")\ntracts <- tracts(\"TN\", \"Shelby\")\nblkgrp <- block_groups(\"TN\", \"Shelby\")\n\nThe above code may look like a lot, but running it will quickly pull from 18 datasets and automatically filter for the Memphis area.

    "text": "The Census conducts over 130 surveys and programs each year, but a handful are especially useful for housing research. In this post I will compare three datasets that provide information on population and housing units: the American Community Survey (1-year & 5-year) and the Population Estimates Program.\n\n\nWhile all Americans are likely aware of the decennial Census, the American Community Survey (ACS) has become the “premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation.”(US Census Bureau 2021) Unlike the decennial Census, which attempts to count every person living in the US, ACS estimates are derived from an annual sample of about 3.5 million addresses. There are nearly 50 subjects included in the ACS, with sub-tables available for each subject, leading to tens of thousands of detailed variables.\nEvery year, the Census Bureau releases a 1-year and a 5-year version of the ACS. The 1-year estimates are collected over a 12-month period for areas with at least 65,000 people, and have a higher margin of error; 5-year estimates are for areas with fewer than 65,000 people over a period of 60 months, and have a lower margin of error.(US Census Bureau 2020) ACS 5-year estimates should be labeled to show all years data was collected, not just the midpoint or year the dataset was released (for example “2015-2019 ACS 5-Year” is correct but not “2017 ACS 5-Year” or “2019 ACS 5-Year”).\nWhen comparing data over time, the Census Bureau recommends using 1-year data, or to compare 5-year estimates that do not overlap, such as 2009-2013 estimates and 2014-2018 estimates. Five-year estimates are more precise, but they are also less likely to show year-to-year fluctuations or recent trends.(US Census Bureau 2020) Users should also research how ACS questions have changed over time, and whether certain variables/time frames should or should not be compared.\nLastly, the 2020 Census ran into significant data collection problems due to COVID. As such, the Census Bureau will not release its standard 2020 ACS 1-year estimates, but experimental estimates. The 5-year ACS will still be released as normal.\n\n\n\nThe ACS was designed to provide information about the characteristics of a population, rather than basic counts of population and housing.(US Census Bureau 2020) The Census Bureau recommends that this data should instead be collected from the Population Estimates Program (PEP), available for states, metro/micro areas, counties, and places.\nRather than being based on a survey, the PEP estimates population by using the most recent decennial Census, combined with administrative records on birth, death, and migration rates.(Walker 2021) Housing unit estimates are determined by new residential construction, new mobile homes, and the estimated number of housing units lost.(US Census Bureau 2019)\n\n\n\nCensus methodology to estimate housing units for the PEP. (Census Bureau)\n\n\nPEP estimates are used as controls for other surveys including the ACS, American Housing Survey, and Housing Vacancy Survey."

    "text": "Shelter is one of the three fundamental needs of human existence. No housing program can be sound unless the shelter it provides is healthful.\nC.-E. A. Winslow, Dr.P.H., Chairman,\nAllan A. Twichell, Technical Secretary,\nCommittee on the Hygiene of Housing (Mar., 1938)\n\n\n\nDr. John H. Griscom stood before an audience in January 1852 and gave a lecture on the importance of clean air, a topic he believed “was not so much studied as it ought to be.” His words were summarized on the front page of the New-York Daily Times the next day, concluding with Dr. Griscom’s statement that “ventilation in houses should be attended to as one of the best means of preserving health.”1 The idea quickly spread—two and a half years later, an article describing the poor conditions of a building in Buffalo declared, “we intended to speak on the ventilation, but we are sick of the subject.”2\nOver the next half century, large population influx into urban areas led to widespread development of tenement housing.3 These homes offered little in the way of space, sanitation, light, or fresh air, a fact made well-known by Jacob Riis’s 1890 book How the Other Half Lives. The conditions documented by Riis led New York City to adopt the first housing codes in the United States.\nHousing reformers continued to demand better living conditions into the 20th century. Catherine Bauer’s landmark 1934 book Modern Housing stated that for a home to be “modern”, it must allow for cross-ventilation and sunlight; adequate privacy, space, and sanitary facilities; adjacent play space for children; and “finally it will be available at a price which citizens of average income or less can afford.”4 Modern housing, Bauer said, was constructed for “efficient use” rather than “quick profit”, and planned to retain quality for the long term, in “complete neighborhoods” with parks, schools, and other community facilities.\nInspired by post-war European housing programs, Bauer advocated for housing to be treated as a public utility and for the government to ensure comprehensively planned, decent, and stable housing for the working class, not just low-income households.5 She believed modern homes and neighborhoods were a means to an end, and could “never deteriorate into a slum, or a ‘blighted area’.”6\nBauer’s thesis contradicted the limited federal housing legislation that existed at the time. A post-Depression policy enacted under Hoover provided loans to corporations wholly focused on low-income housing and slum reconstruction.7 However, a lack of private investment led FDR to alter the program a year later into a public works initiative which directly funded construction of low cost housing and slum clearance projects.8 Outside of wartime efforts, this was the first instance of the US federal government constructing housing for its citizens.\nBauer was later a primary author on the National Housing Act of 1937, which officially established public housing in America and called for “the elimination of unsafe and insanitary housing conditions” and to remedy “the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income, in rural or urban communities.”9\nHowever, the Act was a compromise. Limits were placed on construction costs and tenant incomes, and an “equivalent elimination” clause required one unit of substandard housing be taken down for every unit of public housing built. This ensured the bulk of public housing projects would be in previous slum areas, and was meant to prevent public housing from competing with the private market.10\nThe bill’s co-sponsor, Senator Wagner, stated “the most important consideration is, that public housing projects should not be brought into competition with private industry… To reach those who are really entitled to public assistance, and to get into the field where private enterprise cannot operate, is the objective of this bill.”11 Still, the bill faced significant lobbying efforts that threatened its passage. The organizations that mobilized against the bill were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Real Estate Boards, the U.S. League of Building and Loans, and the National Retail Lumber Dealers Association.12\n\n\n\nThe 1937 Act led to the creation of the Committee on the Hygiene of Housing, appointed by the American Public Health Association. The following year, the committee published the Basic Principles of Healthful Housing in the American Journal of Public Health. The manual outlined 30 principles “believed to be fundamental minima required for the promotion of physical, mental, and social health,” whether the housing be high or low cost, urban or rural.13 The fundamental needs were divided into four categories: physiological needs (e.g. protection from elements), psychological needs (e.g. adequate privacy), protection against contagion (e.g. safe water supply), and protection against accidents (e.g. fire prevention).\nSix decades after Healthful Housing was published, the manual found renewed relevance in 1999. Recognizing that “health, home construction, and home maintenance are inseparable because of their overlapping goals,” HUD and CDC joined together to launch the Healthy Homes Initiative.14 Most of the basic principles originally laid out in the 1938 manual were used to create the Healthy Home Rating System (HHRS).\nThe below table lists all 29 hazards of the modern HHRS, along with a short description and list of populations are most vulnerable to the each hazard.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HHRS established a standardized way for inspectors to identify and rate the risk of home health hazards. Once a hazard is identified, it is further assessed for severity and the effect it is having, or could have, on the occupants. The greater the risk or more serious the outcome, the higher the overall score. The system provides a way to compare risks associated with different types of hazards.\nAccording to HUD16, this system lets local housing and health departments know which hazards are most serious to occupants, allowing them to prioritize funding. It also lets local policy makers identify which areas of the community are in greatest need and what health impacts those communities are facing.\n\n\n\nThere is a plethora of literature from the field of public health related to the impact of housing quality on residents. The more time a person spends indoors, the more exposed they are to biological, chemical, and physical agents that can affect their health and safety.17 Research and findings in the field can lead to national legislation to protect the public health. For instance, the effects of lead-based paint were found to be so severe that all lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978.18\nExtensive research has been conducted on the relationship between asthma and housing quality. Asthma, a respiratory disease which causes episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, has been linked to mold exposure and dampness.19 Additionally, the degree of household disrepair contributes to the amount of allergens carried by pests such as cockroaches.20\nIn recent years, increased attention has been directed at the connection between housing and mental health, particularly related to housing instability. For nine months, Tsai et al.21 monitored the health and housing status of 121 tenants who had appeared in eviction court. Persistent housing and mental health issues were present: 42% of tenants had appeared in eviction court before; 44% had previously been homeless; 39% screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder; 37% for post-traumatic stress disorder; 33% for major depressive disorder; and 17% reported suicidal ideation.\n\n\n\nLarge structural damages can create major health risks, but repairs can be expensive and difficult to implement. Low-income renters can face added difficulty, as tenants have little or no power to repair such problems. A study of low-income parents of children with asthma found landlords were directly involved in keeping homes in poor condition, even when asked by the tenant to fix the property, and a cycle of fear, poverty, and lack of power compounded to make tenants hesitant to report problems.22 Relocating families can reduce health risks, but higher rents associated with safer housing can make it financially difficult or impossible for some families to move.23\nCurrent regulation of private rental housing quality assumes that tenants will take action to report substandard housing, yet this is often not the case. To understand the disconnect between the law’s expectations and reality, Chisholm, Howden-Chapman, and Fougere24 collected existing qualitative literature to explore power dynamics in the landlord-tenant relationship. The research showed that, for the most part, tenants who “reported housing quality problems found it a stressful experience, with repairs taking a long time to be carried out, or not at all.” This experience often impacted future behavior, causing tenants to avoid reporting problems because they did not think it would be effective.\nIn some cases, tenants would rather move out than work towards a resolution, leaving the issue open for future tenants. In other instances, tenants with low incomes were aware of the lack of alternative housing, causing them to remain silent. Fear of eviction prevented tenants from reporting problems, and this fear was not unfounded; in three of the 15 studies, tenants who reported housing problems were evicted or forced to move. Though laws against retaliatory action might exist, no-cause evictions allow landlords to still remove the tenant from the unit. The authors conclude that tenants do not report housing quality problems because the regulation that relies on their reporting fails to protect many tenants."

    "text": "Places in Shelby County\nWhile 40% of households in the Memphis MSA are renters, this percentage varies when we subdivide the metro area. In general, there are more rental units in a central city/county compared to neighboring areas. This section will focus on Shelby County, and any mention of “Memphis” refers exclusively to the city of Memphis.\n\n\n\nThe following table shows the percentage of renters for places in Shelby County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the overall MSA is majority owner-occupied, the city of Memphis is mostly renters, with 53% of all households renting. While this paper does not include a time-series analysis, it’s worth mentioning that only within the past decade has Memphis shifted from being majority owner- to majority renter-occupied. For reference, the 2007-2011 5-year ACS reported that Memphis households were 53% owner, 47% renter. This means there was a 6 percentage point increase in rentership over an 8 year period.\nThe next highest percentage of renters is in Millington, which is home to a Naval base, drawing in residents who are often only temporarily stationed (and thus more likely to rent). Just over a third of households in unincorporated Shelby County are renters. Of larger suburbs with more than 10,000 residents, Collierville has the most renters, and the town’s rent percentage is more than 6 points higher than Bartlett or Germantown.\nLakeland has the smallest percentage of renting households in the county. However, this percentage is likely to change in the coming years, with developments in Lakeland that will bring more than 800 multifamily units. In response to the massive influx, Lakeland passed an 18-month moratorium on standalone apartment buildings in October 2019 to give the city “a little bit of breathing room” and allow development of the city’s schools and infrastructure.26 Under pressure from residents, the moratorium was extended in October 2020 for another two years and expanded to include all new apartment development, including mixed-use projects. In response to citizen concerns, the mayor stated, “There’s just no taste in Lakeland for apartments right now.”27\nGermantown has also sought to limit new multifamily housing. The city first initiated an 18-month moratorium on all apartment development in January 2018, followed by a shorter moratorium on standalone, single-use multifamily complexes. In January 2020, the city’s aldermen voted to ban these complexes altogether by amending zoning ordinances. Apartments and condos are still allowed in certain areas of the city if they are part of mixed-use developments.28\nMeanwhile, Collierville has been home to Schilling Farms, “the premier mixed-use development in West Tennessee and the Mid-South region,” since the early 1990s. The site contains 1,180 apartments and the town recently voted to expand and include another 259 rental units.29\nThe map below shows the percentage of renters in Shelby County census tracts. The map is interactive, and the layers button to the left can be used to change the map background (ESRI.WorldImagery offers a satellite view).\n\nPercent of Renters in Shelby County Census Tracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracts with the highest percentage of renters are mostly located near the downtown core of Memphis. There are exceptions, notably in Millington and in the southeastern corner of Memphis, near Germantown. The areas with the lowest percentage of renters are in the northeastern portion of Shelby County and in parts of Germantown and Collierville."

    "text": "Race/Ethnicity\nAre certain racial/ethnic groups more likely to be renters than others? The table below shows how much certain racial/ethnic groups are present in the total population, compared to how much they are present in the renter population. In a place with no disparity in tenure, we would expect these percentages to be equal (i.e., if Black households make up 60% of all households, they would also comprise 60% of all renters). The last column shows the percentage point difference for each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the above table, Black households make up 62% of all households in Memphis, yet around 71% of renting households, a difference of 9 percentage points. Hispanic/Latino households are also slightly more likely to rent compared to their representation in the total number of households. Meanwhile, Asian households are slightly less likely to rent compared to their overall representation. The largest disparity is in White households; though they make up about 31% of all households in Memphis, they only account for 20% of all renters, a difference of 10 percentage points.\nIn summary, there is a significant disparity in tenure of White and Black households compared to their total representation in households. White households are significantly less likely to rent, while black householders are significantly more likely to rent. Hispanic/Latino households are also more likely to rent, and Asian households less likely to rent, but the disparity is much smaller.\nThe following map shows, for each census tract in Shelby County, what percentage of renters are represented by each racial/ethnic group.\n\nRace/Ethnicity of Renters in Shelby County Census Tracts\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map shows distinct divisions of where certain racial/ethnic groups rent. White renters make up a majority along the Poplar corridor and in areas outside the city limits. Meanwhile, Black renters make up the majority of renting households in North and South Memphis, and in unincorporated parts of the county to the east and along the Mississippi River. Hispanic/Latino renters are most represented in and near the Berclair neighborhood (within the I-240 loop, north of Summer Avenue and west of Highland Street). Asian renters are predominantly outside the city of Memphis, in the suburbs of Germantown, Collierville, and Bartlett.\n\n\nMortgage Discrimination\nThere are many reasons why a household may rent instead of own, but mortgage discrimination is certainly a contributor to the large racial disparity in homeownership. Memphis has been subject to historical and recent mortgage discrimination.\nWhen the federal government began insuring home loans in the 1930s, they commissioned color-coded maps that rated the mortgage risk of neighborhoods in every major metro area in America. The manuals used by assessors prioritized newly built suburban neighborhoods and encouraged segregation, calling for lower ratings in neighborhoods with “inharmonious racial groups.”30\nBlack neighborhoods were also rated high-risk, even if the neighborhood was solidly middle class with single-family homes. High-risk neighborhoods were shaded red, leading to the term “redlining,” and the federal government either denied these loans or charged higher rates to account for the “risk.”31 The practice of redlining denied homeownership and intergenerational wealth building to non-White families.32\n\n\n\nA color-coded map of Memphis created in the 1930s to rate mortgage risk. Original source: National Archives and Records Administration, accessed via High Ground News.\n\n\nOverall, 69% of the city was deemed “hazardous” (red) or “definitely declining” (yellow), notably including all of Downtown and the majority of North and South Memphis. Only 7% of the city received an A rating (“best”, green), including the Central Gardens neighborhood, areas adjacent to Overton Park, Chickasaw Gardens, and East Memphis neighborhoods adjacent to golf courses. The remaining 24% of the city (“still desirable”, blue) contains other Midtown neighborhoods and follows the Poplar Avenue corridor to the east.33\nUnfortunately, mortgage discrimination has continued into the 21st century. In recent years, at least three major lawsuits have been settled by banks accused of discriminatory lending in Memphis,34 and another case was recently opened.\nExcessive foreclosures following the Great Recession led Memphis and Shelby County to file suit against Wells Fargo for targeting Black neighborhoods for predatory lending practices, which the bank settled for $425 million in 2012.35 After the mortgage crisis, banks became selective of whom they targeted and approved for mortgages, often at the expensive of non-white residents. In 2016, BancorpSouth and First Tennessee Bank settled separate suits for $10.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, against accusations of disproportionately denying loan applications to non-white borrowers and failing to build branches in non-white neighborhoods.36\nIn October 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Department of Justice filed suit against Trustmark Bank for allegedly discriminating “against Black and Hispanic neighborhoods by deliberately not marketing, offering, or originating home loans to consumers in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis metropolitan area.” They also allege the bank “discouraged consumers residing in or seeking credit for properties located in these neighborhoods from applying for credit.” The allegations are all in regards to recent behavior, from 2014 to 2018.37"

    "title": "Capstone Draft",
    "section": "Cost Burden",
    "text": "Cost Burden\nDo renters pay more of their income to housing than owners? The more a household pays towards housing, the less they will have for other needs, and the less they will be able to put towards savings. If renters want to own yet pay most of their income towards rent, they will have a harder time saving the money necessary for a down payment. Additionally, households that are already cost burdened will have difficulty finding new housing if housing costs are increasing.\nIn this section I use “cost burden” as a general term to mean “housing costs as a percentage of household income in the past 12 months.” The following graphs exclude households who have zero/negative income or who do not pay rent. For this reason, percentages mentioned may not total 100%.\n\nAll Households\nThe federal government determines affordable housing to be no more than 30% of a person’s income. Someone paying over 30% is considered cost burdened; more than 50% is extremely cost burdened. These measures are not perfect—smaller income households may find 30% is still stressful, while larger income households can pay over 30% and still be well off.\nThe graph below shows housing cost burden for households in Memphis, separated by tenure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden by tenure\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the majority of households in Memphis have affordable housing, with 62% paying less than 30% of their income towards housing, compared to 35% who are cost burdened. However, separating households by tenure reveals that the majority of households with affordable housing are owner-occupied units. In fact, more renters are cost burdened than have affordable housing. Comparatively, very few homeowners are cost burdened.\nAs mentioned above, households with higher incomes can afford to pay more of their income towards housing; while they may be literally cost burdened, they can still easily meet their other needs. The figure below divides the above graph in three income brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden by income by tenure\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, households earning less than $35,000 are mostly renters, and the vast majority of these renters are cost burdened. While there are also many owner-occupied households earning less than $35,000, their housing costs are more often affordable.\nHouseholds in the middle income range are much more likely to have affordable housing. There are nearly an identical number of owners and renters with affordable units. Slightly more renters are cost burdened, but the difference is very small compared to low-income earners.\nNearly all housing is affordable for households earning more than $75,000, no matter the tenure. For the few households who are cost burdened, they are likely still financially secure. At this income range, households are much more likely to own than to rent.\n\n\nRenters\nNext, let’s take a deeper look into housing costs paid by renters. Recall that households who pay more than 50% of their income in rent are considered extremely cost burdened. These households are shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden for renters\n\n\n\n\nJust over 40% of renting households in Memphis have affordable housing, while the majority, 51%, are cost burdened in some way. When we break down cost burden, we see there are more renters who are extremely cost burdened than those who face a moderate burden.\nAs before, let’s separate our graph by income. This time I will take a more detailed look at income groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden by income for renters\n\n\n\n\nBelow $20,000, the vast majority of renters face extreme cost burden and there are very few with affordable housing. The largest percentage of renters in Memphis earn between $20,000 to $34,999, and nearly all of these renters are still cost burdened, though most no longer face extreme burden. Only above $35,000 are a majority of renters affordably housed, with a very small rate of extreme burden. Above $50,000, the vast majority of renters have affordable housing and cost burden is infrequent, and it is practically nonexistent above $75,000. However, there are few renters at this income range compared to lower income ranges.\nIn order to be affordably housed, a household earning $35,000 should pay no more than $875 per month. Half, 50%, of renting households in Memphis earn below $35,000. This graph suggests there is a large shortage of rental homes below this price.\n\n\nRace\nA recent Zillow research report discussed where rent burden is most unequal in major metro areas across the US.38 The data used combines ACS rent and income data, migration data, and Zillow rent data to estimate cost burden for renters by race. The research is useful because it offers a more up-to-date analysis of cost burden than is currently available from the Census.\nNote that while my analysis in this section has focused on the city of Memphis, this graph is for the Memphis metro area.\n\n\n\nFigure from Zillow Research\n\n\nThe above graph shows consistent disparities in rent affordability between Black and White households in the Memphis MSA. The latest data from August 2021 shows the average Black renter is cost burdened, paying 32.1% of their income towards rent, while the average White renter is affordably housed, paying 24.2% towards rent. Affordability for White renters has remained constant since around January 2019, hovering around 24%. Over the same period, cost burden for Black renters has worsened from 30.3% to 32.1%.\n\n\nGovernment Assistance\nIn the face of such high rates of rent burden, some may wonder how much the government is assisting with housing costs. The Memphis Housing Authority (MHA) is the local agency that manages public housing and housing vouchers. According to the agency’s annual plan, the MHA manages 2,565 public housing units and provides 8,031 vouchers, for a total of 10,596 government-supported units. Due to funding limits, the MHA is not able to fully meet the housing needs of residents in the city. MHA’s public housing and HCV programs each have waiting lists, yet even the waiting lists are closed. The HCV waiting list was last opened in 2017 and currently has over 15,000 people on the list.39"

Note that while most of the analysis on this page is specifically for Memphis, the AHS surveys the entire metro region.\n\n\n\nAccording to the AHS, 93.53% of renters in the Memphis MSA had adequate housing, while 6.47% had moderately or severely inadequate housing. The table below shows the most common problems renters experience. Rows marked with an asterisk (*) are related to exterior problems; the AHS only collects this data for single-family structures.\n\nTable 4: Housing Quality Problems in Memphis MSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nEstimate\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nSigns of cockroaches in last 12 months\n50,900\n22.72%\n\n\nSigns of mice or rats inside home in last 12 months\n24,400\n10.89%\n\n\nWater leakage from inside structure in last 12 months\n19,500\n8.71%\n\n\nWater leakage from outside structure in last 12 months\n18,900\n8.44%\n\n\nUncomfortably cold for 24 hours or more last winter (occupying the same home, with heating equipment)\n12,300\n6.61%\n\n\nBroken windows*\n7,600*\n6.46%*\n\n\nOpen cracks or holes (interior)\n14,400\n6.43%\n\n\nWith fuse or breaker blown in last 3 months\n14,100\n6.30%\n\n\nMissing roofing material*\n7,000*\n5.95%*\n\n\nMold in last 12 months\n11,800\n5.27%\n\n\nHole in roof*\n4,200*\n3.57%*\n\n\nMissing bricks, siding, or other outside wall material*\n3,900*\n3.32%*\n\n\nWith no toilet working some time in last 3 months\n7,000\n3.13%\n\n\nRooms without electric outlets\n6,600\n2.95%\n\n\nWith water stoppage in last 3 months\n6,400\n2.86%\n\n\nBroken plaster or peeling paint (interior)\n5,300\n2.37%\n\n\nSewage breakdown in last 3 months\n5,100\n2.34%\n\n\nExposed wiring\n3,900\n1.74%\n\n\n\nThe AHS reports that pests are the most common problem renters experience: 23% reported recently spotting signs of cockroaches, and 11% for mice or rats. Water leakage problems affected 8-9% of renters, likely contributing to the 5% who reported mold. Many homes are not properly sealed, with 6% of renters reporting broken windows and open cracks or holes. This can contribute to pest problems and residents being uncomfortably cold in their homes.\nIf the percentage of renters experiencing a problem seems small compared to the overall number of renters, it’s useful to look at the estimates. For instance, the number of renter-occupied units who have seen signs of mice or rats within the past year is larger than the total number of households in any one of Memphis’s incorporated suburbs in Shelby County. The number of renters who have recently experienced mold is roughly equal to the total number of households in Millington, Arlington, and Lakeland, combined."

    "section": "Renter-Occupied Households",
    "text": "Renter-Occupied Households\nThere are two main ways to study the population of an area using Census data: individuals and households. In a place where all individuals live alone, the number of households and individuals would be identical. When multiple people live together in the same housing unit, they are counted as one household. Additionally, the Census counts individuals who live in group quarters, like nursing homes, adult correctional facilities, and military quarters, separate from renter- and owner-occupied households.\nTypically when we think of population, we are referring to the number of individuals in a place. However, this paper seeks to understand the characteristics of renters. For this topic, a wider range of Census data is available when we narrow our scope to households. There are certain limitations—demographic data is limited to the head of the household, and if multiple individuals under the same household have different characteristics, some data will be omitted. Still, the data allows a general understanding of an area’s population. As such, any mentions of “renters” in the below sections refers to renter-occupied households, rather than individual renters.\n\nRenter Locations\nWhere do renters live? The first half of this section compares the percentage of renters in the Memphis MSA with other large metro areas in the US. The second portion focuses on Shelby County, and breaks down which places and census tracts contain the highest percentage of renters.\n\n\nUS Metro Areas\nBefore studying renters in Memphis, it’s useful to know how the area compares to other metro areas in the US. A metro area (also called a metropolitan statistical area, or MSA) is a geographic boundary created by the US Census. It contains a county with an urban core, and surrounding counties with “a high degree of social and economic integration” (measured by commute to work).25 Any mention of “Memphis” in this section refers to the Memphis MSA, which includes eight counties spanning Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas.\n\n\n\nThe table below lists the top 50 metros in the US (by number of households), sorted by the percentage of renters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemphis ranks 43rd in the US for the total number of households in a metro area. However, Memphis has the 10th highest percentage of renters in a metro, with 40% of all households renting. Comparatively, Nashville ranks 36th for total number of households, and 35th for the percentage of renters. Memphis has the largest difference between these ranks for the top 10 metros with the highest rent percentage. Thus we can conclude Memphis has an above average percentage of renters compared to other metros in the US.\n\n\nPlaces in Shelby County\nWhile 40% of households in the Memphis MSA are renters, this percentage varies when we subdivide the metro area. In general, there are more rental units in a central city/county compared to neighboring areas. This section will focus on Shelby County, and any mention of “Memphis” refers exclusively to the city of Memphis.\n\n\n\nThe following table shows the percentage of renters for places in Shelby County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the overall MSA is majority owner-occupied, the city of Memphis is mostly renters, with 53% of all households renting. While this paper does not include a time-series analysis, it’s worth mentioning that only within the past decade has Memphis shifted from being majority owner- to majority renter-occupied. For reference, the 2007-2011 5-year ACS reported that Memphis households were 53% owner, 47% renter. This means there was a 6 percentage point increase in rentership over an 8 year period.\nThe next highest percentage of renters is in Millington, which is home to a Naval base, drawing in residents who are often only temporarily stationed (and thus more likely to rent). Just over a third of households in unincorporated Shelby County are renters. Of larger suburbs with more than 10,000 residents, Collierville has the most renters, and the town’s rent percentage is more than 6 points higher than Bartlett or Germantown.\nLakeland has the smallest percentage of renting households in the county. However, this percentage is likely to change in the coming years, with developments in Lakeland that will bring more than 800 multifamily units. In response to the massive influx, Lakeland passed an 18-month moratorium on standalone apartment buildings in October 2019 to give the city “a little bit of breathing room” and allow development of the city’s schools and infrastructure.26 Under pressure from residents, the moratorium was extended in October 2020 for another two years and expanded to include all new apartment development, including mixed-use projects. In response to citizen concerns, the mayor stated, “There’s just no taste in Lakeland for apartments right now.”27\nGermantown has also sought to limit new multifamily housing. The city first initiated an 18-month moratorium on all apartment development in January 2018, followed by a shorter moratorium on standalone, single-use multifamily complexes. In January 2020, the city’s aldermen voted to ban these complexes altogether by amending zoning ordinances. Apartments and condos are still allowed in certain areas of the city if they are part of mixed-use developments.28\nMeanwhile, Collierville has been home to Schilling Farms, “the premier mixed-use development in West Tennessee and the Mid-South region,” since the early 1990s. The site contains 1,180 apartments and the town recently voted to expand and include another 259 rental units.29\nThe map below shows the percentage of renters in Shelby County census tracts. The map is interactive, and the layers button to the left can be used to change the map background (ESRI.WorldImagery offers a satellite view).\n\nPercent of Renters in Shelby County Census Tracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracts with the highest percentage of renters are mostly located near the downtown core of Memphis. There are exceptions, notably in Millington and in the southeastern corner of Memphis, near Germantown. The areas with the lowest percentage of renters are in the northeastern portion of Shelby County and in parts of Germantown and Collierville."

    "section": "Renter Demographics",
    "text": "Renter Demographics\nThis section will explore characteristics of renting households in Memphis. First I look at the race/ethnicity of renters and where certain racial/ethnic groups are more likely to live. Included in this section is an analysis of mortgage discrimination in Memphis, to explain some of the large disparities in homeownership. Then I breakdown how much households spend on housing, and address the amount of government assistance available to renters.\n\nRace/Ethnicity\nAre certain racial/ethnic groups more likely to be renters than others? The table below shows how much certain racial/ethnic groups are present in the total population, compared to how much they are present in the renter population. In a place with no disparity in tenure, we would expect these percentages to be equal (i.e., if Black households make up 60% of all households, they would also comprise 60% of all renters). The last column shows the percentage point difference for each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the above table, Black households make up 62% of all households in Memphis, yet around 71% of renting households, a difference of 9 percentage points. Hispanic/Latino households are also slightly more likely to rent compared to their representation in the total number of households. Meanwhile, Asian households are slightly less likely to rent compared to their overall representation. The largest disparity is in White households; though they make up about 31% of all households in Memphis, they only account for 20% of all renters, a difference of 10 percentage points.\nIn summary, there is a significant disparity in tenure of White and Black households compared to their total representation in households. White households are significantly less likely to rent, while black householders are significantly more likely to rent. Hispanic/Latino households are also more likely to rent, and Asian households less likely to rent, but the disparity is much smaller.\nThe following map shows, for each census tract in Shelby County, what percentage of renters are represented by each racial/ethnic group.\n\nRace/Ethnicity of Renters in Shelby County Census Tracts\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map shows distinct divisions of where certain racial/ethnic groups rent. White renters make up a majority along the Poplar corridor and in areas outside the city limits. Meanwhile, Black renters make up the majority of renting households in North and South Memphis, and in unincorporated parts of the county to the east and along the Mississippi River. Hispanic/Latino renters are most represented in and near the Berclair neighborhood (within the I-240 loop, north of Summer Avenue and west of Highland Street). Asian renters are predominantly outside the city of Memphis, in the suburbs of Germantown, Collierville, and Bartlett.\n\n\nMortgage Discrimination\nThere are many reasons why a household may rent instead of own, but mortgage discrimination is certainly a contributor to the large racial disparity in homeownership. Memphis has been subject to historical and recent mortgage discrimination.\nWhen the federal government began insuring home loans in the 1930s, they commissioned color-coded maps that rated the mortgage risk of neighborhoods in every major metro area in America. The manuals used by assessors prioritized newly built suburban neighborhoods and encouraged segregation, calling for lower ratings in neighborhoods with “inharmonious racial groups.”30\nBlack neighborhoods were also rated high-risk, even if the neighborhood was solidly middle class with single-family homes. High-risk neighborhoods were shaded red, leading to the term “redlining,” and the federal government either denied these loans or charged higher rates to account for the “risk.”31 The practice of redlining denied homeownership and intergenerational wealth building to non-White families.32\n\n\n\nA color-coded map of Memphis created in the 1930s to rate mortgage risk. Original source: National Archives and Records Administration, accessed via High Ground News.\n\n\nOverall, 69% of the city was deemed “hazardous” (red) or “definitely declining” (yellow), notably including all of Downtown and the majority of North and South Memphis. Only 7% of the city received an A rating (“best”, green), including the Central Gardens neighborhood, areas adjacent to Overton Park, Chickasaw Gardens, and East Memphis neighborhoods adjacent to golf courses. The remaining 24% of the city (“still desirable”, blue) contains other Midtown neighborhoods and follows the Poplar Avenue corridor to the east.33\nUnfortunately, mortgage discrimination has continued into the 21st century. In recent years, at least three major lawsuits have been settled by banks accused of discriminatory lending in Memphis,34 and another case was recently opened.\nExcessive foreclosures following the Great Recession led Memphis and Shelby County to file suit against Wells Fargo for targeting Black neighborhoods for predatory lending practices, which the bank settled for $425 million in 2012.35 After the mortgage crisis, banks became selective of whom they targeted and approved for mortgages, often at the expensive of non-white residents. In 2016, BancorpSouth and First Tennessee Bank settled separate suits for $10.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, against accusations of disproportionately denying loan applications to non-white borrowers and failing to build branches in non-white neighborhoods.36\nIn October 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Department of Justice filed suit against Trustmark Bank for allegedly discriminating “against Black and Hispanic neighborhoods by deliberately not marketing, offering, or originating home loans to consumers in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis metropolitan area.” They also allege the bank “discouraged consumers residing in or seeking credit for properties located in these neighborhoods from applying for credit.” The allegations are all in regards to recent behavior, from 2014 to 2018.37\n\n\n\nCost Burden\nDo renters pay more of their income to housing than owners? The more a household pays towards housing, the less they will have for other needs, and the less they will be able to put towards savings. If renters want to own yet pay most of their income towards rent, they will have a harder time saving the money necessary for a down payment. Additionally, households that are already cost burdened will have difficulty finding new housing if housing costs are increasing.\nIn this section I use “cost burden” as a general term to mean “housing costs as a percentage of household income in the past 12 months.” The following graphs exclude households who have zero/negative income or who do not pay rent. For this reason, percentages mentioned may not total 100%.\n\nAll Households\nThe federal government determines affordable housing to be no more than 30% of a person’s income. Someone paying over 30% is considered cost burdened; more than 50% is extremely cost burdened. These measures are not perfect—smaller income households may find 30% is still stressful, while larger income households can pay over 30% and still be well off.\nThe graph below shows housing cost burden for households in Memphis, separated by tenure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden by tenure\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the majority of households in Memphis have affordable housing, with 62% paying less than 30% of their income towards housing, compared to 35% who are cost burdened. However, separating households by tenure reveals that the majority of households with affordable housing are owner-occupied units. In fact, more renters are cost burdened than have affordable housing. Comparatively, very few homeowners are cost burdened.\nAs mentioned above, households with higher incomes can afford to pay more of their income towards housing; while they may be literally cost burdened, they can still easily meet their other needs. The figure below divides the above graph in three income brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden by income by tenure\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, households earning less than $35,000 are mostly renters, and the vast majority of these renters are cost burdened. While there are also many owner-occupied households earning less than $35,000, their housing costs are more often affordable.\nHouseholds in the middle income range are much more likely to have affordable housing. There are nearly an identical number of owners and renters with affordable units. Slightly more renters are cost burdened, but the difference is very small compared to low-income earners.\nNearly all housing is affordable for households earning more than $75,000, no matter the tenure. For the few households who are cost burdened, they are likely still financially secure. At this income range, households are much more likely to own than to rent.\n\n\nRenters\nNext, let’s take a deeper look into housing costs paid by renters. Recall that households who pay more than 50% of their income in rent are considered extremely cost burdened. These households are shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden for renters\n\n\n\n\nJust over 40% of renting households in Memphis have affordable housing, while the majority, 51%, are cost burdened in some way. When we break down cost burden, we see there are more renters who are extremely cost burdened than those who face a moderate burden.\nAs before, let’s separate our graph by income. This time I will take a more detailed look at income groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost burden by income for renters\n\n\n\n\nBelow $20,000, the vast majority of renters face extreme cost burden and there are very few with affordable housing. The largest percentage of renters in Memphis earn between $20,000 to $34,999, and nearly all of these renters are still cost burdened, though most no longer face extreme burden. Only above $35,000 are a majority of renters affordably housed, with a very small rate of extreme burden. Above $50,000, the vast majority of renters have affordable housing and cost burden is infrequent, and it is practically nonexistent above $75,000. However, there are few renters at this income range compared to lower income ranges.\nIn order to be affordably housed, a household earning $35,000 should pay no more than $875 per month. Half, 50%, of renting households in Memphis earn below $35,000. This graph suggests there is a large shortage of rental homes below this price.\n\n\nRace\nA recent Zillow research report discussed where rent burden is most unequal in major metro areas across the US.38 The data used combines ACS rent and income data, migration data, and Zillow rent data to estimate cost burden for renters by race. The research is useful because it offers a more up-to-date analysis of cost burden than is currently available from the Census.\nNote that while my analysis in this section has focused on the city of Memphis, this graph is for the Memphis metro area.\n\n\n\nFigure from Zillow Research\n\n\nThe above graph shows consistent disparities in rent affordability between Black and White households in the Memphis MSA. The latest data from August 2021 shows the average Black renter is cost burdened, paying 32.1% of their income towards rent, while the average White renter is affordably housed, paying 24.2% towards rent. Affordability for White renters has remained constant since around January 2019, hovering around 24%. Over the same period, cost burden for Black renters has worsened from 30.3% to 32.1%.\n\n\nGovernment Assistance\nIn the face of such high rates of rent burden, some may wonder how much the government is assisting with housing costs. The Memphis Housing Authority (MHA) is the local agency that manages public housing and housing vouchers. According to the agency’s annual plan, the MHA manages 2,565 public housing units and provides 8,031 vouchers, for a total of 10,596 government-supported units. Due to funding limits, the MHA is not able to fully meet the housing needs of residents in the city. MHA’s public housing and HCV programs each have waiting lists, yet even the waiting lists are closed. The HCV waiting list was last opened in 2017 and currently has over 15,000 people on the list.39"

    "section": "Housing Characteristics",
    "text": "Housing Characteristics\nThis final section looks into certain qualities of rental housing in Memphis. First I will look into the type of housing renters live in and the year the structures were built. Then I will use data from the American Housing survey to identify common housing quality problems that renters experience.\n\nUnits in Structure\nTypically apartment complexes are associated with renter-occupied housing, but how true is this for Memphis? The graph below divides housing structures into four categories: single-family; duplex, triplex, and quadplexes, which often resemble single-family homes; larger multifamily structures with five or more units; and alternative housing like mobile homes, boats, vans, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnits in structure\n\n\n\n\nThe largest proportion of renters, 43%, live in single-family homes. While the majority of renters live in multifamily units, 16% are in duplexes-quadplexes, and 40% are in larger multifamily structures with five or more units. Less than 1% of renters live in a mobile home, RV, boat, van, or some other form of housing.\n\n\nYear Structure Built\nHow old are the units in which renters live? Older structures are more likely to need maintenance, and they can be susceptible to health risks that are not in newer homes. For instance, the ban on lead based paint was not passed until 1979, and homes built before the ban are likely to have lead paint unless they have been remediated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear structure built\n\n\n\n\nMost renters live in older housing structures. Overall, 62% of renter-occupied housing was built before 1980 (and thus are at risk for lead paint problems). Only 3% of renter-occupied housing was built within the past decade, indicative of the construction shortage after the Great Recession. Overall, the median year built for occupied rental units is 1974, 47 years ago, and unless these homes have been properly maintained they are at risk of housing quality problems.\n\n\nHousing Quality Problems\nEvery five years, the American Housing Survey (AHS) provides data on housing quality problems in the Memphis MSA. The most recent survey was completed in 2019. Note that while most of the analysis on this page is specifically for Memphis, the AHS surveys the entire metro region.\n\n\n\nAccording to the AHS, 93.53% of renters in the Memphis MSA had adequate housing, while 6.47% had moderately or severely inadequate housing. The table below shows the most common problems renters experience. Rows marked with an asterisk (*) are related to exterior problems; the AHS only collects this data for single-family structures.\n\nTable 4: Housing Quality Problems in Memphis MSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nEstimate\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nSigns of cockroaches in last 12 months\n50,900\n22.72%\n\n\nSigns of mice or rats inside home in last 12 months\n24,400\n10.89%\n\n\nWater leakage from inside structure in last 12 months\n19,500\n8.71%\n\n\nWater leakage from outside structure in last 12 months\n18,900\n8.44%\n\n\nUncomfortably cold for 24 hours or more last winter (occupying the same home, with heating equipment)\n12,300\n6.61%\n\n\nBroken windows*\n7,600*\n6.46%*\n\n\nOpen cracks or holes (interior)\n14,400\n6.43%\n\n\nWith fuse or breaker blown in last 3 months\n14,100\n6.30%\n\n\nMissing roofing material*\n7,000*\n5.95%*\n\n\nMold in last 12 months\n11,800\n5.27%\n\n\nHole in roof*\n4,200*\n3.57%*\n\n\nMissing bricks, siding, or other outside wall material*\n3,900*\n3.32%*\n\n\nWith no toilet working some time in last 3 months\n7,000\n3.13%\n\n\nRooms without electric outlets\n6,600\n2.95%\n\n\nWith water stoppage in last 3 months\n6,400\n2.86%\n\n\nBroken plaster or peeling paint (interior)\n5,300\n2.37%\n\n\nSewage breakdown in last 3 months\n5,100\n2.34%\n\n\nExposed wiring\n3,900\n1.74%\n\n\n\nThe AHS reports that pests are the most common problem renters experience: 23% reported recently spotting signs of cockroaches, and 11% for mice or rats. Water leakage problems affected 8-9% of renters, likely contributing to the 5% who reported mold. Many homes are not properly sealed, with 6% of renters reporting broken windows and open cracks or holes. This can contribute to pest problems and residents being uncomfortably cold in their homes.\nIf the percentage of renters experiencing a problem seems small compared to the overall number of renters, it’s useful to look at the estimates. For instance, the number of renter-occupied units who have seen signs of mice or rats within the past year is larger than the total number of households in any one of Memphis’s incorporated suburbs in Shelby County. The number of renters who have recently experienced mold is roughly equal to the total number of households in Millington, Arlington, and Lakeland, combined."

    "section": "Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA)",
    "text": "Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA)\nThe Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) was created in 1972 by the Uniform Law Commission to modernize laws governing rental units. Prior to URLTA, landlords and tenants were bound by common law developed in an agricultural society, based on a theory that a rental lease gave the tenant land, and any buildings or improvements were incidental. Landlords had no obligation to maintain structures; for example, a Tennessee Supreme Court case from 1854 found a tenant responsible for paying all rent due on his lease, despite his home having been flooded and made uninhabitable.40\nURLTA changed many of the agrarian common law principles, notably creating a warranty of habitability for tenants. Under the warranty of habitability, landlords are required to provide and maintain habitable conditions for the premises. If conditions become uninhabitable, URLTA provides remedies to the tenant, including termination of the lease.41\nTennessee was one of the first ten states to enact a version of URLTA, adopting it in 1975. However, Tennessee is unique in that it is the only state that limits URLTA’s application based on population; the law only applies to counties with more than 75,000 people based on the 2010 census.42 While renters in Shelby County qualify for protection under URLTA, residents of neighboring Tennessee counties are excluded.43\nUnder Tennessee’s URLTA, landlords are required to comply with building and housing codes, make repairs, and keep the premises clean and safe.44 They must provide “essential services,” which include utilities and obligations which “materially affect the health and safety of the tenant.”45 If a landlord fails to supply essential services, tenants “shall give written notice to the landlord specifying the breach” and do one of the following: obtain essential services and deduct their cost from the rent; recover damages based on the decrease in the fair rental value; or procure reasonable substitute housing, during which the tenant is excused from paying rent during the period of noncompliance.46\nTenants who give their landlord written notice and follow the remedies laid out in the code are supposed to be protected from retaliation, including rent increases, decreased services, or eviction.47 This may adequately protect tenants under a long-term lease; however, protections are more vague for tenants on short-term leases. Landlords are allowed to evict week-to-week or month-to-month tenants for no cause, as long as adequate notice is given (10 or 30 days, respectively).48\n\nLimits of Legislation\nIf the landlord fails to comply with building and housing codes that materially affect health and safety, tenants may: 1. acquire essential services and deduct their cost from rent; 2. recover damages for the loss in the fair rental value, provided the tenant stays; or 3. move to “reasonable substitute housing” and stop paying rent.\nAs shown in the previous section, most renters in Memphis are cost burdened, usually extremely so, and one would expect “reasonable substitute housing” would be housing in habitable standards. But what if there is no “reasonable substitute housing” for tenants to move to? How strong are the protections for tenants who wish to stay?\n\nRetaliation\nAfter notifying landlords of the problem, tenants who choose to stay are left with two options. The first option is for tenants to pay for repairs themselves and deduct their cost from rent. This places them in default of rent, and they must prove receipts for the essential services they procure. The second option is to “recover damages,” meaning bringing legal action. Both of these options are likely to upset a landlord, placing the tenant at risk of retaliation.\nURLTA has conflicting clauses regarding rent, eviction, and neglected maintenance. Tenants have a right to deduct from rent repairs for essential services (§66-28-502) and tenants are guaranteed protection against retaliation (§66-28-501), but if the tenant is in default in rent they can still be evicted (§66-28-514-(b)(1)(B)). And landlords do not need a reason to evict month-to-month tenants in the first place, provided they give proper notice (§66-28-512).\nHow are tenants meant to be protected from retaliation if landlords need no cause to evict in the first place? How long do retaliation protections last? These questions have lead some states, like California and Washington, to enact “just cause” eviction ordinances, requiring landlords to provide a specific, valid reason to evict tenants (such as non-payment of rent).49\nWith the absence of such protections in Tennessee, lawyers at local renter rights meetings recommend tenants continue paying rent and keep a record of any photos, receipts, and conversations with their landlord to improve their chances in court.\n\n\nBuilding Codes vs. Health Codes\nThe state law is also vague about a landlord’s obligation to comply with “applicable building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety.” Building and housing codes are created and enforced at the city level.\nWhat happens when the building codes do not adequately protect tenant health? In 2018, Memphis replaced local housing codes by adopting the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC).50 The IPMC, developed by the International Code Council (ICC), sets minimum housing standards for existing residential buildings and related environmental conditions.\nThe IPMC is focused on the structure, not the tenant. The building code is extensive and technical. While it is meant to provide for minimum housing standards, it is inadequate at protecting or prioritizing tenant health and safety. Rather, the Healthy Homes Rating System (HHRS) was made for this purpose.\nTo give an example of the ICC’s limitations the ICC’s pamphlet on Mold says: 1. There must be proper ventilation of all interior habitable and occupiable areas along with specific concealed spaces. (IBC §1202, IRC R303) 2. The exterior envelope of all buildings must be provided with vapor retarders, water-resistive barriers, and the necessary flashing. (IBC §R701, 703) 3. The maintenance of existing buildings and structures is of the utmost importance. This includes not only the exterior of the structure but also its plumbing and mechanical systems. (IPMC §304, 403, 504)\nNowhere does the code actually say landlords have a responsibility to remediate mold, even though it’s in the obvious health and safety interest for tenants. If health violations are meant to be enforced by the health department, the Tennessee Department of Health’s website on mold explicitly states: “Give a written request to your landlord for repairs that are needed and keep a copy for your records. It is not recommended that you stop paying rent. The Tennessee Department of Health does not have authority to inspect and require landlords to address mold issues in rental property. Laws to address mold directly are not common.”51 This statement and the lack of attention given to mold by modern governmental agencies is alarming, considering that mold is an ancient issue human have faced. Even the biblical book of Leviticus offers home mold remediation guidance for priests.52 If the Health Department and the IPMC do not protect renter health, who does?\nThe Shelby County Department of Housing’s LEAD based paint program remediated lead paint hazards for low-income homeowners. For homes that qualified, HUD allowed any additional grant funding available to be used to repair home health hazards. Inspectors take before and after photos of home health hazards. When I was a graduate assistant at the SCDH from 2018-2019, it was my job to tag photos with a number, from 1-29, for which HHRS violation was identified and corrected. Recall that Healthy Homes Hazard #1 is “Damp and mold growth.”\nIf inspectors from one department are allowed to use the HHRS to guide home inspections and repair need for housing within Shelby County, can not inspectors from all departments? Particularly in the absence of adequate protections in existing building code."

    "section": "Code Enforcement",
    "text": "Code Enforcement\nWhile state and local laws vary, the use of code enforcement to enforce local housing codes is standard across American cities. The City of Memphis’ states that the Department of Code Enforcement’s purpose is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare related to existing structures.53 The website says the department administers and enforces the IPMC to enforce conditions “which may contribute to deterioration and devaluation of properties in the community,” though there is no mention of resident health.\nIn Memphis, like in many other American cities, residents are told to call ‘311’ to report any problems to a city. This method of self-reporting, while convenient for residents, can create biases in the data and the types of issues code enforcement pursues. A recent study of Kansas City 311 data found that, despite greater need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems.54 Two extensive reports of Memphis code enforcement found that reliance on self-reporting led inspectors to spend a disproportionate amount of time on minor cases, rather than more serious violations.55\nThe Memphis reports, though released nearly two decades apart, contained similar findings and recommendations. Each saw the vast majority of violations were related to nonstructural issues like weeds, junk, and vehicles: the 2001 paper found three out of four properties were cited for these problems, and the 2018 paper stated 81% of all requests were nonstructural.56 Apartment complexes tend to be underreported compared to single-family homes or duplexes.57 The Betts58 paper conducted a visual survey of properties in the Binghampton neighborhood, and while at least half of multi-family properties had violations in multiple units, code enforcement recorded only eight violations out of 1200 apartment units. Both reports recommended fundamentally changing code enforcement from a reactive process built on citizen reporting to a proactive, strategic system.59\nMemphis has already taken this to heart by founding the Strategic Code Enforcement Management Academy (SCEMA) in 2017, which invites individuals from cities around the country to learn and share best practices for code enforcement.\n\nCode Enforcement Process\nDespite an emphasis on strategic enforcement, code enforcement cases according to the city’s website still begin with a citizen report, either by calling 311 or using the app SeeClickFix. Once a complaint is received, an investigation is conducted to assess the violation, determine property ownership, and research past violations at the property. If a violation is found, a code inspector will issue a “Notice to Correct Violation” to the property owner.\nAfter a notice is issued, follow-up inspections are conducted to determine compliance. Depending on the circumstances and severity, the department can then: give an extension; cite the owner to court; issue an order to vacate; issue an order to not occupy until repairs are made; or refer the property to the Condemnation Department. Cases where court action is initiated are resolved in the General Sessions Environmental Court.60"

If a violation is found, a code inspector will issue a “Notice to Correct Violation” to the property owner.\nAfter a notice is issued, follow-up inspections are conducted to determine compliance. Depending on the circumstances and severity, the department can then: give an extension; cite the owner to court; issue an order to vacate; issue an order to not occupy until repairs are made; or refer the property to the Condemnation Department. Cases where court action is initiated are resolved in the General Sessions Environmental Court.60"

    "text": "Original Capstone work\nMemphis code enforcement data is publicly available through the city’s open data portal. The dataset includes all 311 service requests since 2016; it is updated daily, and contains over 1.3 million rows as of January 2022. For the submitted version of my capstone, I original intention was to analyze this dataset to answer a few questions related to renter-occupied housing:\n\nHow often do renters report problems to code enforcement?\nWhat are the most common problems renters report?\nHow are these requests resolved?\nHow long does the process take?\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find a way to answer these questions before the due date of my paper. The dataset’s size was overwhelming, and organized in a way that obscured the answers. Instead, I critiqued how the dataset’s structure made it difficult to find basic information about rental repairs, which limited the city’s capacity to have a strategic code enforcement department. This was not the paper I wanted to write, but it was the path I felt I had to take due to time constraints.\nI have since come to appreciate how far Memphis has come in modernizing the code enforcement process and the limitations of the current system, particularly after watching the documentary In The Absence. I feel my original critiques were too harsh, which is why I’ve taken the time to rewrite this and other sections of the original paper.\nHowever, the importance of being able to answer these questions cannot be understated. A home’s quality directly effects the day-to-day health and safety of its inhabitants. Renters, through the nature of their lease, largely rely on their landlord to maintain a home’s quality. If a landlord neglects this duty and the tenant cannot afford to move, they are supposed to be able to turn to the state for protection.\nBut what is the efficacy of this protection? How well does the City of Memphis and the State of Tennessee protect a renter’s right to a safe and healthy home? Open datasets are meant to allow citizens to hold their government accountable. But from this dataset, I could not even determine how many renters had made requests to code enforcement.\nIt is possible that the majority of renters who report problems see their requests resolved and are protected from retaliation. If we had this data, it could be used to soothe the concerns of tenants who do not report because they worry that enforcing their rights means destabilizing their housing.\nIt is also possible that renters are not adequately protected; problems might not be resolved timely, the resolutions may not adequately decrease health risk, and renters who do report may commonly face retaliation. If this were the case, this data could be used to challenge the status quo and push for stronger renters rights.\nYet the data, as is, cannot be used to answer these questions. The extent of the problem is a black box, and judgments cannot be made one way or the other. Originally I proposed some small changes in data entry methods that would allow researchers to find the answers to my original questions. For instance, while citizens can categorize a service request as being related to a “junky yard” or a “vehicle violation”, there is not a clear cut category for rental repair requests. Instead, these are often filed under “miscellaneous.” Adding a “rental request” option could be a simple way to address this problem.\nStill, I was not satisfied with this conclusion. There is useful information in the dataset, I just had to find a way to extract it. This has been my primary project post-graduation, and I have documented my progress under the “Research” tab of this website, with posts tagged “code enforcement”."

    "text": "Post-graduation progress\nIn the first post I introduced the dataset and gave a brief description of all 53 columns, to determine which were the most relevant to my work. The second post introduced how I manipulate the dataset using R, and looked at the most common service requests categories. There was some basic filtering to find housing-related requests and filter out duplicates, but this process was largely superseded by the third post. Here, I took a step back to explain the concept of tidy data, a standardized way of organizing data that makes it easy for analysts to quickly find information.\nAfter outlining the largest hurdles to achieving a tidy dataset, I detailed my plan and created specific steps and goals. The second half of the post begins chipping away at the first step, and this work is continued in the fourth post.\nEach post walks through all the code I’ve written so far. My ultimate goal has always been to create something reproducible, and to be able to produce monthly or weekly reports on renter requests to code enforcement. When I am closer to a final product, I plan to update this post to share my results and findings. If you are interested in specific hurdles of the dataset and how I have addressed them, please refer to the posts linked above."
