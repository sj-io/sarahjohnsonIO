<p>The <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/">Tennessee Code Annotated</a> contains all state laws for Tennessee. The TCA is available free online, but the website can be sluggish and difficult to use. Below is the 2021 version of Tennessee’s Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act.</p>
<p><strong>Title 66 Property &gt; Chapter 28 Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act</strong></p>
<section id="part-1-general-provisions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-1-general-provisions">Part 1 General Provisions</h2>
<section id="short-title." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-title.">66-28-101. Short title.</h3>
<p>This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.”</p>
</section>
<section id="application-preemption." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application-preemption.">66-28-102. Application — Preemption.</h3>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> This chapter applies only in counties having a population of more than seventy-five thousand (75,000), according to the 2010 federal census.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> This chapter applies to rental agreements entered into or extended or renewed after July 1, 1975. Transactions entered into before July 1, 1975, and not extended or renewed after that date, and the rights, duties and interests flowing from them remain valid and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced as required or permitted by any statute or other law amended or repealed by this chapter as though the amendment or repeal has not occurred.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> Unless created to avoid the application of this chapter, the following arrangements are not governed by this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> Residence at an institution, public or private, if incidental to detention or the provision of medical, geriatric, educational, counseling, religious, or similar service;</li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> Occupancy under a contract of sale of a dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part, if the occupant is the purchaser or a person who succeeds to the purchaser’s interest;</li>
<li><strong>(3)</strong> Transient occupancy in a hotel, or motel or lodgings subject to city, state, transient lodgings or room occupancy under the Excise Tax Act, compiled in title 67, chapter 4, part 20;</li>
<li><strong>(4)</strong> Occupancy by an owner of a condominium unit or a holder of a proprietary lease in a cooperative; or</li>
<li><strong>(5)</strong> Occupancy under a rental agreement covering premises used by the occupant primarily for agricultural purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> This chapter shall not apply to any occupancy in a public housing unit or other housing unit that is subject to regulation by the department of housing and urban development and owned by a governmental entity or non-profit corporation to the extent such regulation conflicts with state law, but shall apply to the extent that any such regulations defer to the application of state law.</p>
<p><strong>(e)</strong> In the counties in which this chapter applies, this chapter occupies and preempts the entire field of legislation concerning the regulation of landlords and tenants. The governing body of a county subject to this chapter shall not enact or enforce regulations that conflict with, or are an addition to, this chapter.</p>
</section>
<section id="purposes-rules-of-construction." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purposes-rules-of-construction.">66-28-103. Purposes — Rules of construction.</h3>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Underlying purposes and policies of this chapter are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> Simplify, clarify, modernize and revise the law governing the rental of dwelling units and the rights and obligations of landlord and tenant;</li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> Encourage landlord and tenant to maintain and improve the quality of housing;</li>
<li><strong>(3)</strong> Promote equal protection to all parties; and</li>
<li><strong>(4)</strong> Make uniform the law in Tennessee.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> Unless displaced by this chapter, the principles of law and equity, including the law relating to capacity to contract, health, safety and fire prevention, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause supplement its provisions.</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> This chapter being a general chapter intended as a unified coverage of its subject matter, no part of it is to be construed as impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation if that construction can reasonably be avoided.</p>
</section>
<section id="chapter-definitions." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-definitions.">66-28-104. Chapter definitions.</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> All landlords of residential property requiring security deposits prior to occupancy are required to deposit all tenants’ security deposits in an account used only for that purpose, in any bank or other lending institution subject to regulation by the state or any agency of the United States government.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b)(2)(B), the tenant shall have the right to inspect the premises to determine the tenant’s liability for physical damages that are the basis for any charge against the security deposit. An inspection of the premises to determine the tenant’s liability for physical damages that are the basis for any charge against the security deposit and the landlord’s estimated costs to repair such damage shall be conducted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>(A)</strong> Upon request by the landlord for a tenant to vacate or within five (5) days after receipt by the landlord of written notice of the tenant’s intent to vacate, the landlord may provide notice to the tenant of the tenant’s right to be present at the inspection of the premises. Such notice may advise the tenant that the tenant may request a time of inspection to be set by the landlord during normal working hours. The landlord may require the inspection to be after the tenant has completely vacated the premises and is ready to surrender possession and return all means of access to the entire premises; provided, that the inspection shall be either on the day the tenant completely vacates the premises or within four (4) calendar days of the tenant vacating the premises. If the landlord provides written notice of the tenant’s right to be present at the landlord’s inspection and the tenant schedules an inspection, but fails to attend such inspection, the tenant waives the right to contest any damages found by the landlord as a result of such inspection by the landlord; provided, that notice of the tenant’s waiver upon such circumstances is set out in the rental agreement.</li>
<li><strong>(B)</strong> If a tenant requests a mutual inspection as provided in subdivision (b)(1)(A), the landlord and tenant shall then inspect the premises and compile a comprehensive listing of any presently ascertainable damage to the unit that is the basis for any charge against the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing the damage. The landlord and tenant shall sign the listing. Except as provided in subsection (g), the signatures of the landlord and the tenant on the listing shall be conclusive evidence of the accuracy of the listing. If the tenant refuses to sign the listing, the tenant shall state specifically in writing the items on the list to which the tenant dissents.</li>

<li><strong>(2)</strong>

<li><strong>(A)</strong> If the tenant has acted in any manner set out in subdivisions (b)(2)(B)(i)-(vi), the landlord may inspect the premises and compile a comprehensive listing of any presently ascertainable damage to the unit that is the basis for any charge against the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing the damage without providing the tenant an opportunity to inspect the premises; provided, that the landlord provides a written copy, sent by certificate of mailing to the tenant, of the listing of any damages and estimated cost of repairs to the tenant upon the tenant’s written request.</li>
<li><strong>(B)</strong> The tenant shall not have a right to inspect the premises as provided in this section if the tenant has:
<ul>
<li><strong>(i)</strong> Vacated the rental premises without giving written notice;</li>
<li><strong>(ii)</strong> Abandoned the premises;</li>
<li><strong>(iii)</strong> Been judicially removed from the premises;</li>
<li><strong>(iv)</strong> Not contacted the landlord after the landlord’s notice of right to mutual inspection of the premises;</li>
<li><strong>(v)</strong> Failed to appear at the arranged time of inspection as provided in subdivision (b)(1); or</li>
<li><strong>(vi)</strong> If the tenant has not requested a mutual inspection pursuant to subsection (b) or is otherwise inaccessible to the landlord.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> No landlord shall be entitled to retain any portion of a security deposit if the security deposit was not deposited in an account as required by subsection (a) and a listing of damages is not provided as required by subsection (b).</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> A tenant who disputes the accuracy of the final damage listing given pursuant to subsection (b) may bring an action in a circuit or general sessions court of competent jurisdiction of this state. The tenant’s claim shall be limited to those items from which the tenant specifically dissented in accordance with the listing or specifically dissented in accordance with subsection (b); otherwise the tenant shall not be entitled to recover any damages under this section.</p>
<p><strong>(e)</strong> Should a tenant vacate the premises with unpaid rent or other amounts due and owing, the landlord may remove the deposit from the account and apply the moneys to the unpaid debt.</p>
<p><strong>(f)</strong> In the event the tenant leaves not owing rent and having any refund due, the landlord shall send notification to the last known or reasonably determinable address, of the amount of any refund due the tenant. In the event the landlord shall not have received a response from the tenant within sixty (60) days from the sending of such notification, the landlord may remove the deposit from the account and retain it free from any claim of the tenant or any person claiming in the tenant’s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>(g)</strong> Nothing in this section precludes the landlord from recovering the costs of any and all contractual damages to which the landlord may be entitled, plus the cost of any additional physical damages to the premises that are discovered after an inspection that has been completed pursuant to subsection (b); provided, however, that costs of any physical damage to the premises may only be recovered if the damage was discovered by the landlord prior to the earlier of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> Thirty (30) days after the tenant vacated or abandoned the premises; or</li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> Seven (7) days after a new tenant takes possession of the premises.</li>

Even if evicted or removed from the lease, the perpetrator shall remain financially liable for all amounts due under all terms and conditions of the present lease agreement.</li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> If a lease agreement is in effect at the time that the domestic abuse is committed, the landlord may remove the perpetrator from the lease agreement and require the remaining adult tenants to qualify for and enter into a new agreement for the remainder of the present lease term. The landlord shall not be responsible for any and all damages suffered by the perpetrator due to the bifurcation and termination of the lease agreement in accordance with this section.</li>
<li><strong>(3)</strong> If domestic abuse, as defined in §36-3-601, is the underlying offense for which tenancy could be terminated, the victim and all adult tenants shall agree, in writing, not to allow the perpetrator to return to the subject premises or any part of the community property, and to immediately report the perpetrator’s return to the proper authority, for the remainder of the tenancy. A violation of such agreement shall be cause to terminate tenancy as to any victim and all other tenants.</li>
<li><strong>(4)</strong> The rights under this section shall not apply until the victim has been judicially granted an order of protection against the perpetrator for the specific incident for which tenancy is being terminated, a copy of such order has been provided to the landlord, and the order:
<ul>
<li><strong>(A)</strong> Provides for the perpetrator to move out or vacate immediately;</li>
<li><strong>(B)</strong> Prohibits the perpetrator from coming by or to a shared residence;</li>
<li><strong>(C)</strong> Requires that the perpetrator stay away from the victim’s residence; or</li>
<li><strong>(D)</strong> Finds that the perpetrator’s continuing to reside in the rented or leased premises may jeopardize the life, health, and safety of the victim or the victim’s minor children.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>(5)</strong> Failure to comply with this section, or dismissal of an order of protection that allows application of this section, abrogates the rights provided to the victim, minor children, and innocent occupants under this section.</li>
<li><strong>(6)</strong> The rights granted in this section shall not apply in any situation where the perpetrator is a child or dependent of any tenant.</li>
<li><strong>(7)</strong> Nothing in this section shall prohibit the eviction of a victim of domestic abuse for non-payment of rent, a lease violation, or any violation of this chapter.</li>
