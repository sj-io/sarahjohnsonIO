title: "Sound vs. Population"

I saw a tiktok about a map of sound data provided by the National Park Service.

The official post can be found [on the NPS website](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/sound/soundmap.htm), including a link to the [original data](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2217356). The NPS has [an FAQ page](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/sound/mapfaq.htm) with additional information about the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
nps_fp <- list.files(file.path(Sys.getenv("MY_DATA_FOLDER"), "geom", "nps"), full.names = TRUE)
nps1 <- nps_fp[[1]]
nps2 <- nps_fp[[2]]
nps3 <- nps_fp[[3]]

test <- raster(nps1, resolution = 100)
test2 <- raster(nps2)
test3 <- raster(nps3)
plot(test)
plot(test2)
plot(test3)

test_proj <- st_transform(test, 5070)
```

```{r}
leaflet() |> 
  addTiles() |> 
  addRasterImage(x = test)
```
